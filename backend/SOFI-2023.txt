 FIGURES
1 Global hunger remained virtually unchanged from
2021 to 2022 but is still far above pre-COVID-19-
pandemic levels 8
2 Progress was made towards reducing hunger in
most subregions in Asia and in Latin America, but
hunger is still on the rise in Western Asia, the
Caribbean and all subregions of Africa 11
3 In 2022, Asia was home to 55 percent (402 million)
of the people in the world affected by hunger, while
more than 38 percent (282 million) lived in Africa 12
4 The prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) is still
higher in 2022 than before the pandemic in
58 percent of countries, and the situation is worse
in low-income countries (77 percent) 13
5 Projected numbers of undernourished indicate
that the world is far off track to achieve Zero Hunger
by 2030 17
6 Moderate or severe food insecurity remained
unchanged at the global level from 2021 to 2022,
with worsening food insecurity levels in Africa and in
Northern America and Europe, and improvements in
Asia and in Latin America and the Caribbean 19
7 The concentration and distribution of food
insecurity by severity differ greatly across the regions
of the world 22
| iv |
8 Food insecurity, at both levels of severity, is higher
in rural areas than in urban areas in all regions except
Northern America and Europe 23
9 Globally and in every region, the prevalence of food
insecurity is higher among women than among men 24
10 Globally in 2021, the cost of a healthy diet
increased and more people were unable to afford the
diet compared to 2019 in all regions except Northern
America and Europe, despite a small decline in
unaffordability from 2020 to 2021 29
11 Most of the people unable to afford a healthy diet
in 2021 lived in Southern Asia, and in Eastern and
Western Africa 30
12 Stunting in children under five years of age and
exclusive breastfeeding have improved and some
progress has been made on wasting, while low
birthweight and overweight in children under five
years of age have not changed 33
13 Low- and lower-middle-income countries bear
the greatest burden of stunting, wasting and low
birthweight, but also have the largest proportion of
exclusively breastfed children; most overweight
children live in lower-middle- or upper-middleincome countries 35
14 The global trends in stunting, wasting, exclusive
breastfeeding and low birthweight must be
accelerated, while for overweight in children they will
have to be reversed, to achieve the 2030 global
nutrition targets 37
15 The prevalence of stunting and wasting was
higher in rural compared to urban areas, while
overweight was more commonly found in urban areas 40

categories of the rural–urban continuum,

23 Two contrasting patterns of urbanization: dense
metropolitan urbanization (Nigeria) and small city
and town dispersed urbanization (Burkina Faso) 75
24 While high food purchases among households
living in urban areas are expected, they are
surprisingly high across the rural–urban continuum,
even for rural households 77
25 There is a marked drop in purchased food
consumption shares for low- and middle-income
households living in peri-urban areas, with levels
similar to rural households in both high- and
low-food-budget countries 79
26 In the 11 countries in Africa, rural households are
consuming processed foods, including highly
processed foods, even those living 1 to 2 hours or
more from a city or town 84
27 In the 11 countries in Africa, low processed and
highly processed food consumption shares are
higher across the rural–urban continuum in lowfood-budget countries, while shares of food away
from home are higher in high-food-budget countries 85
28 In the 11 countries in Africa, the share of staple
foods represents a minority of total household food
consumption in value terms, and rises as income falls
across the rural–urban continuum in both high- and
low-food-budget countries 89
29 In the 11 countries in Africa, animal source foods
and food away from home substitute staple foods,
moving from rural to urban areas 90
30 In the 11 countries in Africa, the cost of a healthy
diet in urban areas is much higher than in peri-urban
areas, and it decreases the smaller the city size and
moving closer to rural areas; this trend is less
pronounced in high-food-budget countries, which
show similar costs across all urban areas 95
31 In the 11 countries in Africa, the higher cost of
animal source foods drives the high cost of a healthy
diet across the rural–urban continuum, especially in
urban and remote rural areas 97
32 The cost of a healthy diet exceeds average food
consumption for low- and middle-income households
in both high- and low-food-budget countries in the
11 countries analysed in Africa 98

CONTENTS
33 In the 11 countries in Africa, the percentage of
the population unable to afford a healthy diet in
peri-urban areas is higher than in urban centres and
similar to rural areas 99
34 In many of the nine countries analysed in Africa,
the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
in urban and peri-urban areas is similar to that in rural
areas, and in some cases, slightly higher, indicating
that food insecurity is not exclusively a rural problem
in most of the countries analysed 101
35 The prevalence of child stunting generally
increases as cities become smaller and moving away
from urban centres; child wasting and overweight are
lower and exhibit less evident trends across the

FOREWORD
This report brings our organizations
together again to reaffirm that, if we do not
redouble and better target our efforts, our
goal of ending hunger, food insecurity and
malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 will
remain out of reach. Although the world
is recovering from the global pandemic,
this is occurring unevenly across and
within countries. On top of this, the world
is grappling with the consequences of the
ongoing war in Ukraine, which has shaken
food and energy markets.
Agrifood systems remain highly vulnerable
to shocks and disruptions arising from
conflict, climate variability and extremes, and
economic contraction. These factors, combined
with growing inequities, keep challenging
the capacity of agrifood systems to deliver
nutritious, safe and affordable diets for all.
These major drivers of food insecurity and
malnutrition are our “new normal”. We have
no option but to redouble our efforts to
transform agrifood systems and leverage them
towards reaching the Sustainable Development
Goal 2 (SDG 2) targets.
Global hunger is still far above pre-pandemic
levels. It is estimated that between 690 and
783 million people in the world faced hunger
in 2022. This is 122 million more people than
before the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless,
the increase in global hunger observed in the
last two years has stalled and, in 2022, there
were about 3.8 million fewer people suffering
from hunger than in 2021. The economic
recovery from the pandemic has contributed
to this, but there is no doubt that the modest
progress has been undermined by rising food
and energy prices magnified by the war in
Ukraine. There is no room for complacency,
though, as hunger is still on the rise throughout
Africa, Western Asia and the Caribbean.
No doubt, achieving the SDG target of Zero
Hunger by 2030 poses a daunting challenge.
Indeed, it is projected that almost 600 million
people will still be facing hunger in 2030. This
is 119 million more people than in a scenario
in which neither the COVID-19 pandemic nor
the war in Ukraine had occurred, and around
23 million people more than in a scenario
where the war had not happened.
Unfortunately, our worries are not only
due to hunger. In 2022, 2.4 billion people,
comprising relatively more women and people
living in rural areas, did not have access to
nutritious, safe and sufficient food all year
round. The persisting impact of the pandemic
on people’s disposable income, the rising
cost of a healthy diet and the overall rise
in inflation also continued to leave billions
without access to an affordable healthy diet.
Millions of children under five years of age
continue to suffer from stunting (148 million),
wasting (45 million) and overweight
(37 million). Despite progress in reducing
child undernutrition – both stunting and
wasting – the world is not on track to achieve
the associated 2030 targets, and neither is
any region on track to attain the 2030 target
for low birthweight, so closely linked to
the nutrition of women before and during
pregnancy. Steady progress is only seen on
levels of exclusive breastfeeding.
These numbers and trends may be a
considerable disappointment for us, but for the
children and people affected, they constitute
an underlying fact of their lives, and this fuels
our determination to keep finding solutions.
Since 2017, when signs of increasing hunger
first began to appear, our organizations,
through this report, have provided in-depth
analysis of the major drivers behind these
concerning trends and evidence-based policy
recommendations to address them.

FOREWORD
We have repeatedly highlighted that the
intensification and interaction of conflict,
climate extremes and economic slowdowns
and downturns, combined with highly
unaffordable nutritious foods and growing
inequalities, are pushing us off track to meet
the SDG 2 targets. While we must remain
steadfast in taking bold targeted actions to
build resilience against these adversities, other
important megatrends must be considered.
Urbanization, for example, is one such
megatrend that features as the theme of
this year’s report. By 2050, almost seven in
ten people are projected to live in cities; but
even today, this proportion is approximately
56 percent. Urbanization is shaping agrifood
systems in ways we can only understand
through a rural–urban continuum lens,
encompassing everything from food
production, food processing, and food
distribution, marketing and procurement,
to consumer behaviour. Due to population
growth, small and intermediate cities and
rural towns are increasingly bridging
the space between rural areas and large
metropolises. Hence, in our efforts to end
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition
in an urbanizing world, we can no longer
operate on the traditional assumption of a
rural–urban divide.
As the world is urbanizing, food demand
and supply are changing rapidly across the
rural–urban continuum, challenging our
traditional thinking. In some contexts, food
purchases are no longer high only among
urban households but also among rural
households living far from an urban centre.
Moreover, consumption of highly processed
foods is also increasing in peri-urban and
rural areas of some countries, whereas
consumption of vegetables, fruits, and fats
and oils is becoming more uniform across
the rural–urban continuum. These important
changes are affecting people’s food security
and nutrition in ways that differ depending on
where they live across this continuum.
To overcome the challenges and seize the
opportunities that urbanization creates,
our actions, policy interventions and
investments will have to be informed by a
clear understanding of how the rural–urban
continuum and agrifood systems interact,
and how, given such interaction, urbanization
affects access to affordable healthy diets, and
consequently food security and nutrition.
The policy approach must go beyond rural
or urban silos and administrative borders
and will require strong and well-coordinated
governance mechanisms and institutions.
The theme of this year’s report is also timely
and relevant for several other reasons. The
policy recommendations can inform countries
on what programmes, investments and actions
can be effective and innovative for meeting the
SDG 2 targets in the context of urbanization.
They are also relevant for the achievement
of other SDGs, including not only SDG 11
(Sustainable Cities and Communities), but also
SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and
Well-Being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)
and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption
and Production).
Recent discussions at the United Nations
General Assembly have raised the importance
of achieving Sustainable Cities and
Communities (SDG 11), as this is closely
related to other important interconnected
issues, including poverty eradication, climate
action, migration, land degradation, economic
prosperity and creation of peaceful societies.
Nonetheless, the related links between
urbanization and the affordability of healthy
diets, and the resulting implications for food
security and nutrition, have not been explored
in these discussions, and we hope this report
| viii |
helps bridge this important gap. The report’s
theme is also aligned with the New Urban
Agenda, endorsed by the United Nations
General Assembly in 2016, and represents
a unique contribution to create awareness
about the importance of improving access to
affordable healthy diets as a critical component
in pursuing sustainable urbanization.
Finally, we hope that this report informs
other ongoing efforts, clearly those of the
coalitions of action established after the
United Nations Food Systems Summit as we
move towards the global stocktaking meeting
to review progress in implementing the
outcomes of the Summit on 24–26 July 2023,
not least the Urban Food Systems Coalition,
the Coalition of Action on Healthy Diets from
Sustainable Food Systems for Children and
All, the School Meals Coalition, and the Zero
Hunger Coalition; as well as the Scaling Up
Nutrition Movement. n

METHODOLOGY
The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023 has been prepared by the FAO Agrifood Economics
Division in collaboration with the Statistics Division of the Economic and Social Development stream and
a team of technical experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the
International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF),
the World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
A senior advisory team consisting of designated senior managers of the five UN publishing partners
guided the production of the report. Led by FAO, this team decided on the outline of the report and
defined its thematic focus. Further, it gave oversight to the technical writing team composed of experts
from each of the five co-publishing agencies. Background technical papers were prepared to support the
research and data analysis undertaken by the members of the writing team.
The writing team produced a number of interim outputs, including an annotated outline, first draft
and final draft of the report. These were reviewed, validated and cleared by the senior advisory team at
each stage in the preparation process. The final report underwent a rigorous technical review by senior
management and technical experts from different divisions and departments within each of the five
UN agencies, both at headquarters and decentralized offices. Finally, the report underwent executive
review and clearance by the heads of agency of the five co-publishing partners.

KEY MESSAGES
è Global hunger, measured by the prevalence
of undernourishment (Sustainable Development
Goal [SDG] Indicator 2.1.1), remained relatively
unchanged from 2021 to 2022 but is still far above
pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels, affecting around
9.2 percent of the world population in 2022 compared
with 7.9 percent in 2019.
è It is estimated that between 691 and 783 million
people in the world faced hunger in 2022.
Considering the midrange (about 735 million),
122 million more people faced hunger in 2022 than in
2019, before the global pandemic.
è From 2021 to 2022, progress was made towards
reducing hunger in Asia and in Latin America, but
hunger is still on the rise in Western Asia, the Caribbean
and all subregions of Africa.
è It is projected that almost 600 million people will
be chronically undernourished in 2030. This is about
119 million more than in a scenario in which neither
the pandemic nor the war in Ukraine had occurred,
and around 23 million more than if the war in Ukraine
had not happened. This points to the immense
challenge of achieving the SDG target to eradicate
hunger, particularly in Africa.
è The prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity at the global level (SDG Indicator 2.1.2)
remained unchanged for the second year in a
row after increasing sharply from 2019 to 2020.
About 29.6 percent of the global population – 2.4 billion
people – were moderately or severely food insecure
in 2022, of which about 900 million (11.3 percent of
people in the world) were severely food insecure.
è Worldwide, food insecurity disproportionately
affects women and people living in rural areas.
Moderate or severe food insecurity affected
33.3 percent of adults living in rural areas in 2022
compared with 28.8 percent in peri-urban areas and
26.0 percent in urban areas. The gender gap in food
insecurity at the global level, which had widened in the
wake of the pandemic, narrowed from 3.8 percentage
points in 2021 to 2.4 percentage points in 2022.
è More than 3.1 billion people in the world –
or 42 percent – were unable to afford a healthy diet
in 2021. While this represents an overall increase
of 134 million people compared to 2019, before the
pandemic, the number of people unable to afford a
healthy diet actually fell by 52 million people from
2020 to 2021.
è Worldwide in 2022, an estimated 148.1 million
children under five years of age (22.3 percent)
were stunted, 45 million (6.8 percent) were wasted,
and 37 million (5.6 percent) were overweight.
The prevalence of stunting and wasting was higher
in rural areas, while overweight was slightly more
prevalent in urban areas.
è Steady progress has been made on increasing
exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life
and reducing stunting among children under five years
of age, but the world is still not on track to achieve the
2030 targets. Child overweight and low birthweight
have changed little, and the prevalence of wasting is
more than double the 2030 target.
è Increasing urbanization, with almost seven in ten
people projected to live in cities by 2050, is driving
changes in agrifood systems across the rural–urban
continuum. These changes represent both challenges
and opportunities to ensure everyone has access to
affordable healthy diets.
è Challenges include a greater availability of cheaper,
convenience, pre-prepared and fast foods, often energy
dense and high in fats, sugars and/or salt that can
contribute to malnutrition; insufficient availability of
vegetables and fruits to meet the daily requirements of
healthy diets for everyone; exclusion of small farmers
from formal value chains; and loss of lands and natural
capital due to urban expansion.
è But urbanization also presents opportunities,
as it results in longer, more formal and complex food
value chains that expand income-generating activities
in off-farm employment, especially for women and
youth, and increase the variety of nutritious foods.
Farmers often gain better access to agricultural inputs
and services as urban areas grow closer to rural areas.
| xvi |
è Understanding the changes occurring throughout
agrifood systems (i.e. from food production, food
processing, and food distribution and procurement,
to consumer behaviour) requires a rural–urban
continuum lens, reflecting the growing connectivity and
interlinkages across urban, peri-urban and rural areas.
è While already quite advanced in Asia and Latin
America, changes in food demand and supply across
the rural–urban continuum are accelerating in Africa,
where the shares of the population that are food
insecure and unable to afford a healthy diet are among
the highest in the world. Here the expansive growth in
off-farm employment and interconnected food markets
and food supply chains is driving a diet transition across
the rural–urban continuum.
è New evidence for 11 Western, Eastern and
Southern African countries challenges the traditional
thinking that food purchases make up a small share
of rural households’ food consumption in Africa.
Food purchases are high among urban households
in these countries, but they are also surprisingly high
across the rural–urban continuum, even among rural
households living far from an urban centre.
è New evidence also challenges the conventional
thinking that purchase patterns between urban and
rural areas differ markedly. In the 11 African countries
studied, although consumption of processed foods,
including highly processed foods, is higher in urban
areas, it only declines gradually moving to peri-urban and
rural areas. Moreover, consumption of vegetables, fruits,
and fats and oils is fairly uniform across the rural–urban
continuum relative to total food consumption.
è The affordability of a healthy diet is becoming more
critical to households living in peri-urban and rural
areas because they rely more on food purchases. In the
11 African countries studied, despite the lower cost of
a healthy diet in these areas, affordability is still lower
than in urban centres. Low-income households living in
peri-urban and rural areas are especially disadvantaged,
as they would need to more than double their food
expenditure to secure a healthy diet.
è In many of these African countries studied, food
security is not exclusively a rural problem, as moderate
or severe food insecurity across urban areas (large,
intermediate and small cities and towns) and peri-urban
areas (less than 1 hour travel to large, intermediate and
small cities) is similar to and sometimes even slightly
higher than in rural areas.
è The prevalence of child overweight is at risk
of increasing with the emerging problem of high
consumption of highly processed foods and food away
from home in urban centres, which is increasingly
spreading into peri-urban and rural areas.
è Increasing access to affordable healthy diets and
achieving food security and nutrition for all require
a policy approach and legislation that leverage the
increasing connectivity between rural and peri-urban
areas and cities of various sizes.
è The closer linkages among agrifood systems
segments create opportunities for win–win situations in
terms of greater economic development and access to
affordable healthy diets, which can be seized through
investments in infrastructure, public goods and enhanced
capacities that improve rural–urban connectivity.
Such investments should support the essential role
of small and medium enterprises in agrifood systems,
particularly in small and intermediate cities and towns.
è Public investment in research and development
needs to be increased to develop technologies and
innovations for healthier food environments and for
increasing the availability and affordability of nutritious
foods. Technology can be particularly important to boost
the capacity of urban and peri-urban agriculture to
supply nutritious foods in cities and towns.
è Leveraging connectivity across the rural–urban
continuum will require adequate governance mechanisms
and institutions to coordinate coherent investment beyond
sectoral and administrative boundaries. To this end,
subnational governments can play a key role in designing
and implementing policies beyond the traditional
top-down approach. Approaches to agrifood systems
governance should ensure policy coherence among local,
regional and national settings through the engagement of
relevant agrifood systems stakeholders at all levels.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This year, the update to the global assessment of
food security and nutrition reflects a particular
moment in history. While the pandemic, the
ensuing economic rebound, the war in Ukraine,
and soaring prices of food, agricultural inputs
and energy have all played out differently
across regions with differing impacts, new
estimates indicate hunger is no longer on the
rise at the global level but is still far above
pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels and far off track to
achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.
As past editions of this report have highlighted,
the intensification of the major drivers of food
insecurity and malnutrition – conflict, climate
extremes, economic slowdowns and downturns,
and growing inequality – often occurring in
combination, is challenging our efforts to achieve
the SDGs. There is no question these threats will
continue, requiring that we remain steadfast to
build resilience against them. However, there
are still important megatrends that must be
fully understood when devising policies to meet
the SDG 2 targets.
One such megatrend, and the focus of this year’s
report, is urbanization. As urbanization increases,
rural and urban areas are becoming more
intertwined, and the spatial distinction between
them is becoming more fluid. The changing
pattern of population agglomerations across
this rural–urban continuum is driving changes
throughout agrifood systems, creating both
challenges and opportunities to ensure everyone
has access to affordable healthy diets.
After presenting the latest updates of the food
security and nutrition situation around the world,
the report then examines the drivers, patterns and
dynamics of urbanization through a rural–urban
continuum lens and presents new analysis on
how urbanization is changing food supply and
demand across the rural–urban continuum.
Complementing this, further analyses for
selected countries explore differences in the cost
and affordability of a healthy diet, and in food
insecurity and different forms of malnutrition
across the rural–urban continuum.
Building on these insights, the report identifies
policies, investments and new technologies to
address the challenges, and capitalize on the
opportunities, that urbanization brings for
ensuring access to affordable healthy diets for
everyone, across the rural–urban continuum.
FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION
AROUND THE WORLD
Food security indicators – latest
updates and progress towards ending
hunger and ensuring food security
The global assessment of the state of food
security and nutrition in 2022 is a snapshot of the
world still recovering from a global pandemic
and now grappling with the consequences of
the war in Ukraine, which has rattled food and
energy markets. Encouraging signs of economic
recovery from the pandemic and projections
of a decline in poverty and hunger have been
tempered by rising food and energy prices.
Global hunger in 2022, measured by
the prevalence of undernourishment
(SDG Indicator 2.1.1), remained far above
pre-pandemic levels. The proportion of the world
population facing chronic hunger in 2022 was
about 9.2 percent, compared with 7.9 percent
in 2019. After increasing sharply in 2020 in the
midst of the global pandemic, and rising more
slowly in 2021 to 9.3 percent, the prevalence
of undernourishment ceased to increase from
2021 to 2022. It is estimated that hunger affected
between 691 million and 783 million people in
the world in 2022. Considering the projected
midrange (about 735 million in 2022), 122 million
more people faced hunger in 2022 than in 2019,
before the pandemic.
The economic recovery from the pandemic helped
to stem the rising tide of hunger at least at the
global level. However, the positive effect could
have been even larger without the countervailing
winds caused by the global repercussions of
the war in Ukraine and rising prices of food,
agricultural inputs and energy, together with
| xviii |
other drivers of food insecurity such as conflicts
and weather-related events.
The relative lack of change in hunger at the
global level from 2021 to 2022 hides substantial
differences at the regional level. Progress was
made towards reducing hunger in most subregions
in Asia and in Latin America, but hunger is still
on the rise in Western Asia, the Caribbean and
all subregions of Africa. The proportion of the
population facing hunger is much larger in Africa
compared with the other regions of the world –
nearly 20 percent compared with 8.5 percent
in Asia, 6.5 percent in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and 7.0 percent in Oceania.
Updated projections show that almost 600 million
people will be chronically undernourished in
2030, pointing to the immense challenge of
achieving the SDG target to eradicate hunger.
This is about 119 million more undernourished
people than in a scenario in which neither the
pandemic nor the war in Ukraine had occurred,
and around 23 million more than in a scenario in
which the war had not happened.
SDG Target 2.1 challenges the world not only to
end hunger, but also to work to ensure access
for all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food all year round. SDG Indicator 2.1.2 – the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
in the population, based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES) – tracks progress towards
this ambitious goal.
New estimates of the prevalence of food
insecurity based on the FIES confirm that for
2022 no progress was made on food insecurity
at the global level. Following a sharp increase
from 2019 to 2020, the global prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity remained
unchanged for the second year in a row, far
above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels. In 2022, an
estimated 29.6 percent of the global population –
2.4 billion people – were moderately or severely
food insecure, meaning they did not have access
to adequate food. This is still 391 million more
people than in 2019, before the pandemic.
The prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity rose slightly in Africa and in
Northern America and Europe, and decreased
non-significantly in Asia from 2021 to 2022.
The only region showing encouraging progress
was Latin America and the Caribbean, mainly
in South America, although the food security
situation deteriorated in the Caribbean subregion.
A comparison of food insecurity in rural,
peri-urban and urban populations at the global,
regional and subregional levels using the Degree
of Urbanization (DEGURBA) classification, a new
international standard, shows that at the global
level, food security improves as the degree of
urbanization increases. Moderate or severe food
insecurity affected 33.3 percent of adults living in
rural areas in 2022 compared with 28.8 percent in
peri-urban areas and 26.0 percent in urban areas.
Persistent gender inequalities are revealed by
the new FIES data. Food insecurity is more
prevalent among adult women than men in every
region of the world, although the gap narrowed
considerably at the global level from 2021 to
2022. In 2022, 27.8 percent of adult women were
moderately or severely food insecure, compared
with 25.4 percent of men, and the proportion
of women facing severe food insecurity was
10.6 percent compared with 9.5 percent of men.
Cost and affordability of a healthy diet
The revised analysis presented in this year’s
report shows that almost 3.2 billion people
worldwide could not afford a healthy diet in 2020,
with a slight improvement in 2021 (a decrease
of 52 million people). The cost of a healthy diet
increased globally by 6.7 percent between 2019
and 2021, with a notable single-year increase
of 4.3 percent in 2021. The cost increased by
more than 5 percent between 2020 and 2021 in
Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean,
and Oceania, but only marginally in Northern
America and Europe.
In many countries, the increase in the cost of
a healthy diet occurred in combination with
| xix |
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
a decline in disposable income following the
persisting effects of the pandemic. Lockdowns,
economic downturns, and other pandemic-related
disruptions in 2020 led to job losses and reduced
incomes for many people, affecting low-income
households the most as they spend a higher share
of income on food.
A slight turnaround occurred in 2021, when the
number of people unable to afford a healthy diet
declined by 52 million compared to 2020, but this
is still 134 million more people than in 2019 before
the pandemic. Most of the people unable to afford
a healthy diet in 2021 lived in Southern Asia, and
in Eastern and Western Africa.
The state of nutrition: progress towards
global nutrition targets
Nutrition is mentioned specifically in SDG 2
but is central to the achievement of all 17 SDGs.
This section presents an assessment of progress
towards global nutrition targets for stunting,
wasting and overweight among children under
five years of age, exclusive breastfeeding and low
birthweight. Updated data were not available
for anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years and
for adult obesity.
Stunting, the condition of being too short for
one’s age, undermines the physical and cognitive
development of children. Stunting and other
forms of undernutrition early in life may
also predispose children to being overweight
and developing non-communicable diseases
(NCDs) later in life. Globally, the prevalence of
stunting among children under five years of
age has declined steadily, from an estimated
33.0 percent (204.2 million) in 2000 to 22.3 percent
(148.1 million) in 2022.
Child wasting is a life-threatening condition
caused by insufficient nutrient intake, poor
nutrient absorption and/or frequent or prolonged
illness. Affected children are dangerously
thin, with weakened immunity and a higher
risk of mortality. The prevalence of wasting
among children under five years of age declined
from 8.7 percent in 2000 to 6.8 percent in
2022. The estimated number of children with
wasting declined from 54.1 million in 2000 to
45.0 million in 2022.
Children who are overweight or obese face both
immediate and potentially long-term health
impacts, including a higher risk of NCDs later in
life. Child overweight has been on the rise in many
countries, hastened by increasingly inadequate
levels of physical activity and increased access to
highly processed foods. Globally, the prevalence
of overweight among children under five years
of age showed a non-significant increase from
5.3 percent (33.0 million) in 2000 to 5.6 percent
(37.0 million) in 2022.
The latest estimate for low birthweight revealed
that 14.7 percent of newborns (19.8 million) were
born with low birthweight (less than 2 500 g)
in 2020, a non-significant decline from the
16.6 percent (22.1 million) in 2000. Infants born
weighing less than 2 500 g are approximately
20 times more likely to die than those with
adequate birthweight, and those who survive face
long-term development and health consequences.
Optimal breastfeeding practices, including
exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months
of life, are critical for child survival and the
promotion of health and cognitive development.
Globally, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding
among infants under six months of age has
risen from 37.0 percent (24.3 million) in 2012 to
47.7 percent (31.2 million) in 2021. Worldwide,
over half of all infants under six months of
age did not receive the protective benefits of
exclusive breastfeeding.
Low- and lower-middle-income countries bear
the greatest burden of stunting, wasting and low
birthweight but also have the largest proportion
of exclusively breastfed children. Most overweight
children live in these country income groups.
At the global level, the prevalence of stunting and
wasting was higher in rural areas than in urban
areas while overweight was more commonly
found in urban areas.

The results from these analyses help to identify
vulnerable population groups, contributing to
evidence to inform decision-making and effective
action through the appropriate targeting and
design of policies and programmes. Sound
nutrition is fundamental to the achievement of
the Sustainable Development Goals and must
be central in government policy and supported
by key stakeholders, including civil society and
the private sector.
URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING
AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS AND AFFECTING
ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHY
DIETS ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN
CONTINUUM
Drivers, patterns and dynamics
of urbanization
Urbanization is the result of urban population
growth, urban expansion (i.e. reclassification
of rural areas to peri-urban or urban) and
migration from rural to urban areas. This process
is fast-changing, context specific and driven by
intertwined factors.
Many parts of the world have rapidly urbanized,
with the urban share of the world’s population
rising from 30 percent in 1950 to 57 percent in
2021. It is projected to reach 68 percent by 2050.
In most regions, this has been largely driven
by structural transformation, which entails
an economic transformation from mainly
agriculture to a more diversified national
economy, in the process attracting rural people
to urban areas.
While urbanization often goes hand in hand with
economic growth and structural transformation,
this does not hold for all countries and regions.
Urbanization without economic growth can be
linked to poor rural living conditions, including
poverty, lack of employment or underemployment,
lack of infrastructure, lack of access to services,
and food insecurity.
Another factor that may contribute to urbanization
is climate change and/or environmental
degradation, which can affect rural-to-urban
migration movements. Populations that depend
on natural resources for their livelihoods can be
compelled to migrate to urban areas in search of
work, due to the effects of climate change and
biodiversity loss. There is also an increasing
occurrence of forced displacement from rural
areas to urban areas, often as a result of disasters
and/or conflict.
With urban expansion and improving road and
communication infrastructure across larger parts
of rural areas, the distinction between rural
and urban areas is increasingly blurred. A large
share of the new urban dwellers are expected to
live in peri-urban areas, as well as in small cities
and interconnected towns. Increasingly, rural
and urban areas are less separate spaces in their
own right, but rather two ends of a spectrum,
connected via numerous linkages across a
rural–urban continuum.
Almost half of the global population (47 percent)
live in peri-urban areas (less than 1 hour to large,
intermediate and small cities or towns) and rural
areas (1 to 2 hours or more to an urban centre).
Given the increasing connectivity of peri-urban
and rural areas and the convergence of high food
purchases in both, it is clear that peri-urban and
rural markets are significant drivers of agrifood
systems transformation.
The degree of connectivity between rural and
urban areas shapes agrifood systems, and thus the
availability of affordable healthy diets, and the
livelihoods of urban and rural primary producers,
processors and traders. Depending on where urban
growth takes place, whether in large, intermediate
and small cities or towns, there will be different
effects on rural populations’ access to services,
markets and inputs. A rural–urban continuum
framework is therefore critical to understand the
links between urbanization and agrifood systems
changes and how these changes are affecting the
availability and affordability of healthy diets, and
in turn, food security and nutrition.
| xxi |
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Urbanization affects agrifood systems,
creating challenges and opportunities to
ensure access to affordable healthy diets
Urbanization, combined with other contextual
factors such as rising incomes, growing
employment and changing lifestyles, is driving
changes throughout agrifood systems across
the rural–urban continuum. Increases in
food demand in urban areas are occurring
simultaneously with increases in the amount
of food that agrifood systems have to produce,
process and distribute, which, together with
changes in consumer behaviour, are being
seen across the rural–urban continuum. These
changes may also lead to disparities across the
rural–urban continuum, with both positive
and negative effects on the availability and
affordability of healthy diets, and in turn, on
food security and nutrition outcomes.
One of the most important pathways through
which urbanization is driving changes in agrifood
systems is through a shift in consumer behaviour
and diets. Higher average incomes, combined
with changing lifestyles and employment, are
driving a diet transition characterized by changes
in the types and quantities of food consumed,
with diets shifting beyond traditional grains
into dairy, fish, meat, vegetables and fruits.
There is a diffusion of food purchases in rural
areas, more so than is commonly understood.
The diet in these areas has shifted from
mainly home-produced foods to increasingly
market-purchased products.
However, urbanization has also contributed
to the spread and consumption of processed
and highly processed foods, which are
increasingly cheaper and more readily available
and marketed. Changes in the lifestyles and
employment profiles of both women and men,
as well as increasing commuting times, are
resulting in greater demand for convenience,
pre-prepared and fast foods. The diet transition
is also occurring in rural areas, though lagged
and to a lesser extent compared to urban and
peri-urban areas.
Urbanization is also leading to changes in
midstream and downstream food supply
chains, which have become longer, more formal
and more complex following rising consumer
demand and increased regulation of agrifood
systems. Importantly, growing midstream
and downstream activities provide important
off-farm employment opportunities, which can
provide steady and liveable incomes, increasing
the affordability of healthy diets.
Supply-side factors, coupled with an increase
in demand for readily available foods, have
contributed to a substantial expansion of
supermarkets and hypermarkets that use modern
food technology. While these markets can be
linked to increased access to nutritious foods
– through reduced waste, enhanced sanitation
and reduced adverse effects of seasonality, for
example – they have also been associated with
increased supply of energy-dense and highly
processed foods.
Urbanization, in particular, by increasing the
connectivity of rural and urban areas, also
affects agrifood systems through changes in
agricultural production. While urbanization
is often associated with a diversification of
diets, the availability of vegetables and fruits,
in particular, is insufficient to meet the daily
dietary requirements in almost every region of
the world.
As urban areas become better connected to rural
areas, rural producers may also have better access
to agricultural inputs and services, allowing for
improved productivity that typically increases
income levels. However, urban expansion can
lead to land-use change. In some countries,
farmers receive high compensation for selling
their land, whereas in others, dispossession of
agricultural land is not compensated, resulting
in loss of livelihoods and potential issues
around land rights.
Access to affordable healthy diets is generally
better and food security and nutrition levels are
higher in cities than in rural areas because of
| xxii |
the better availability of food, higher average
purchasing power in urban areas, and better
access to health care, education and other services
that are essential for health and nutrition.
However, this does not always hold true given the
transformations underway in agrifood systems,
the stark inequalities that exist within urban
populations, and the increasingly spatial and
functional connectivity between cities, towns and
rural catchment areas.
THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND
DEMAND AND THE COST AND
AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTHY DIETS
ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN
CONTINUUM
Understanding food supply and demand
across the rural–urban continuum
Urbanization, combined with rising incomes,
increases in the opportunity cost of time related
to work, lifestyle changes and demographic shifts,
is changing food demand. These factors together
with many supply-side considerations, including
food pricing, marketing and promotion, among
others, in turn are changing agrifood systems, so
there is a reinforcing compounding effect on the
food produced, supplied and consumed.
Most notably, rapid urbanization is leading
to rising and changing food demand, and
shifts in patterns of food supply – especially
in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, the
two regions exhibiting the highest urbanization
rates. Projections of overall food expenditure
estimate an approximate 2.5-fold increase in
sub-Saharan Africa and a 1.7-fold increase in
Southern Asia by 2050.
Analysis of food demand, defined as household
food consumption (at market value), across the
rural–urban continuum in selected countries
was conducted and revealed interesting
patterns. This was made possible by applying
the newly available geospatial Urban Rural
Catchment Areas (URCA) dataset combined
with georeferenced data from nationally
representative Living Standards Measurement
Study (LSMS) surveys. For reasons of data
availability, the surveys used covered the period
2018/19 for Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,
Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, the Niger, Nigeria,
Senegal and Togo, and 2019/20 for Malawi.
Given it is expected that diets become
more diversified with higher levels of food
consumption, income and employment, the
11 countries were classified into two groups
according to their food budget (i.e. the market
value of their total food consumption per
capita per day): high-food-budget countries
(average 2.3 PPP dollars per capita per day) and
low-food-budget countries (average 1.6 PPP
dollars per capita per day).
New empirical evidence from this analysis,
challenges traditional thinking and reveals
important food consumption patterns, including
dietary convergence across the rural–urban
continuum. For example, across the 11 countries,
food purchases form the majority of total food
consumption in value terms, including food for
home consumption and food away from home.
While high shares of food purchases in urban
areas are to be expected (78–97 percent), shares
are surprisingly high even for rural households
living 1 to 2 hours from a small city or town
(56 percent on average) and for those living more
than 2 hours travel to any urban centre (52 percent
on average). The finding that in most of the
countries analysed, the "majority" of household
food consumption in rural households comes
from purchases is a major deviation from the
traditional image of rural subsistence households.
Own production never becomes the main source
for food – not even in rural areas. In rural
areas, the average share of own production
represents only 37 percent and 33 percent of
total consumption in high- and low-food-budget
countries, respectively. Given that rural
households in the 11 African countries do not
produce the majority of the food value they
| xxiii |
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
consume, the affordability of healthy diets is
equally critical across the rural–urban continuum.
While the diffusion of processed foods, including
highly processed foods, is already advanced in
Asia and Latin America, it is spreading quickly
in Africa as well. In the 11 African countries
studied, the analysis clearly shows a diffusion
of purchases of processed foods across the
rural–urban continuum. While highly processed
foods are a small proportion of total purchases
and their consumption is higher in urban areas,
the results highlight the penetration of highly
processed foods in rural areas, even those
living 1 to 2 hours or more from a city or town.
The econometric analysis indicates that higher
levels of household income and more non-farm
employment are associated with a higher
consumption value share of highly processed
foods in the 11 African countries.
In the 11 African countries, looking at household
food composition in terms of the value shares of
food consumption by food group, a diet transition
is clearly occurring across the rural–urban
continuum, with increases in the consumption
of more expensive food items, like animal source
foods and fruits. The econometric analysis
indicates that animal source food consumption
value shares are strongly driven by income
across the rural–urban continuum, while the
consumption value shares of fruits and vegetables
are driven more by access and availability.
Cost and affordability of a healthy diet,
and food security and nutrition across the
rural–urban continuum
On average, across the 11 countries in Africa
analysed, the cost of a healthy diet in urban
centres is much higher (on average 1.2 times
higher) than in peri-urban areas and it then
decreases the smaller the city size and moving
closer to rural areas. The higher cost of animal
source foods, compared to the other food groups,
drives up the cost of a healthy diet across the
rural–urban continuum, especially in urban and
remote rural areas.
The cost of a healthy diet exceeds average
food expenditure for low- and middle-income
households in both high- and low-food-budget
countries in the 11 countries analysed.
Low-income households living in peri-urban and
rural areas are especially disadvantaged, as they
would need to more than double their current
expenditure on food to secure a healthy diet.
Although the cost of a healthy diet in peri-urban
areas is lower than in urban areas, this does not
translate into a more affordable healthy diet in
the former. On average, the percentage of the
population unable to afford a healthy diet in
peri-urban areas is 1.5 times higher than in urban
centres and similar to rural areas.
An analysis of food insecurity based on the
FIES for 9 of the 11 African countries shows that
in many of these countries, the prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity in urban and
peri-urban areas is similar to that in rural areas,
and in some cases, slightly higher, indicating that
food insecurity is not exclusively a rural problem.
The prevalence of malnutrition across the ten
URCA categories was only estimated for 3 of
the 11 countries, due to data limitations. In the
three countries (Benin, Nigeria and Senegal),
generally the prevalence of stunting in children
under five years of age gradually increases as
cities become smaller and as one moves away
from urban centres.
The prevalence of wasting in children under
five years of age is lower than that of stunting
in all three countries and exhibits less evident
trends across the rural–urban continuum.
Nevertheless, there are hints of increased
wasting in some peri-urban and rural areas in
Nigeria and Senegal. Similarly, the prevalence
overweight among children is low in all
countries and does not present a clear trend
across the rural–urban continuum. However,
it is worth noting there is a suggestion towards
lower overweight in peri-urban areas and higher
overweight in some rural areas compared to
urban areas.

POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE
AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION
FOR HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS THE
RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
The increased links across the rural–urban
continuum coupled with closer interactions
between the components of agrifood systems
create a number of opportunities and challenges
for the availability and affordability of healthy
diets. Such interactions also create a number of
policy and programme entry points to support
agrifood systems transformation towards
affordable healthy diets.
Policies and investments for healthy diets
across the rural–urban continuum
Supporting healthier food outlets will be key
for enabling access to healthy diets, as this has
shown positive impacts on dietary quality.
Policy incentives are necessary to encourage
shops to stock and sell greater amounts of fresh
and minimally processed foods, for instance, by
improving their cold storage facilities, while the
availability of healthier food outlets in particular
areas across the rural–urban continuum can
be improved through land-use planning and
zoning regulations; tax credits or exemptions;
and licensing agreements.
In urban and peri-urban settings, an estimated
2.5 billion people worldwide consume street foods
every day, which are especially convenient for
low-income workers and households who may
not have the resources, facilities and/or time to
prepare dishes at home. However, street foods do
not always contribute to healthy diets. There are
multiple infrastructure and regulatory gaps that
need to be addressed to improve the nutritional
quality and safety of these foods. These include
ensuring a supply of water of acceptable quality
for food preparation, clean places for preparation
and consumption of food, sanitary facilities
for workers, training for street vendors and
consumer education.
Given that one-fourth of the global population
live in peri-urban areas of small and
intermediate cities and towns (SICTs), investing
in these can have a more significant impact on
healthy diets for their populations compared to
the benefits that trickle down from growth in
large cities. Addressing some of the challenges
faced by SICTs can allow agrifood systems to be
the driver of inclusive rural development, and
create development opportunities for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs).
The presence of processed foods in household
diets across the whole rural–urban continuum
constitutes a driving force for the expansion of
the services provided by SMEs. Strengthening
their efficiency and expansion can also
contribute to gains in production of nutritious
foods, and a parallel reduction in the cost of
food for consumers.
Building rural infrastructure, including quality
rural and feeder roads to connect remote
farms and enterprises to main road networks,
is essential for unlocking the productive
potential of SICTs and their catchment areas.
Other public investments to support linkages
between (mainly small) farms and SMEs
could include warehousing, cold storage,
dependable electrification, access to digital
tools and water supply.
Finally, considering that the availability of fruits
and vegetables per capita per day is insufficient
to meet the requirements of a healthy diet in
most parts of the world, it is essential to boost
the production of nutritious foods and, in
general terms, support the diversification of
food production.
Technology and innovation: a key enabler
for agrifood systems transformation
under urbanization
In an urbanizing world, the strategic deployment
of technology and innovation can be a critical
catalyst of agrifood systems transformation.
| xxv |
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Countries have varied needs and capacities, and
while there is a plethora of technologies and
innovations available, no single “silver bullet”
technology or innovation will meet all needs in
all contexts across the rural–urban continuum.
Whether these technologies and innovations
are inclusive for all depends not only on their
adoption and impact, but also on how research
and development (R&D) is shaped. Between 1981
and 2016, there was a doubling of global public
investment in agricultural R&D, with significant
increases in larger middle-income countries
(MICs); however, smaller lower-middle-income
countries (LMICs) continue to have insufficient
investment compared to other components
of general services support such as
infrastructure investments.
In urbanizing contexts, where consumers are
increasingly exposed to highly processed
foods, different technological and innovative
food environment solutions can contribute
to reducing their consumption. For instance,
behavioural science is an essential innovation
that enables governments, scientists and
the public to work together to develop
evidence-based approaches to increase access
to affordable healthy diets, as well as empower
consumers to choose healthy diets.
As already noted, urbanization is leading to a
growing demand for packaged and pre-prepared
foods. Innovations in food packaging can
maintain the quality, safety and nutritional
value of food products, meet consumer needs
and preferences, reduce food loss and waste,
and reduce the cost of nutritious foods, especially
across longer distribution chains.
Finally, there are numerous technologies and
innovations that can be leveraged for enhancing
productivity in rural, urban and peri-urban
areas, as well as for closing the productivity
gap in LMICs, especially in the face of the
climate crisis and the disappearance of natural
resources. For example, vertical farming
requires only a small plot of land and can be
carried out indoors, allowing for the cultivation
of food in urban and industrial spaces, and
leading to shorter supply chains.
Integrated planning and governance
mechanisms across the rural–urban
continuum
Transformative policies, technologies and
innovations require adequate governance
mechanisms that, while engaging multiple
actors, can coherently address the challenges
and leverage the opportunities created in
agrifood systems under urbanization.
Due to the multisectoral nature of the challenges
and opportunities that urbanization creates
across the rural–urban continuum, subnational
governments are important actors for formulating
and implementing coherent policies that go
beyond agrifood systems and outside normal
administrative borders. These governments
are in close contact with local stakeholders
and can ensure that policies are adapted to
local conditions by promoting advantages and
addressing bottlenecks.
An important starting point towards streamlining
governance across the rural–urban continuum
is the development of locally based agreements
between multiple administrative zones and
multistakeholder platforms and networks.
Among such mechanisms, food policy
councils serve as advisory bodies to local or
subnational governments, support policy design
and implementation, promote stakeholder
engagement, and facilitate monitoring and
evaluation of progress in policy implementation,
effectiveness, efficiency and impact.
The design and implementation of local agrifood
systems policies, investments and legislation for
addressing multiple agrifood systems challenges
and opportunities requires working outside
“silos” and bridging the gaps between policy
areas in order to achieve systemic changes.
| xxvi |
Policy coherence at national and subnational
levels remains a key challenge in establishing the
appropriate enabling environment. Therefore,
these policies and investments will require strong
multilevel governance across national and regional
agrifood systems policies. The establishment of
national networks engaging various levels of
governments appears an important starting point
to initiate such multilevel governance mechanisms.
CONCLUSION
Hunger at the global level did not worsen
between 2021 and 2022, but there are many places
in the world where hunger is on the rise – where
people are still struggling to recover income
losses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic,
or have been hit by climbing food and energy
prices, or whose lives and livelihoods have
been disrupted by conflicts or extreme weather
events. Progress on important indicators of child
nutrition is to be celebrated, and some regions are
on track to achieve some of the nutrition targets
by 2030. However, rising overweight and obesity
in many countries portends growing burdens of
non-communicable diseases.
Urbanization has featured as the theme of
this year’s report. With almost seven in ten
people projected to live in cities by 2050, this
megatrend is shaping agrifood systems and, as a
consequence, their capacity to deliver affordable
healthy diets for all and to help eradicate
hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.
A key conclusion is that the ways in which
urbanization is shaping agrifood systems can only
be understood through a rural–urban continuum
lens; the simple concept of a rural–urban divide
is no longer useful to understand the growing
links across urban, peri-urban and rural areas.
This growing connectivity across the rural–urban
continuum is a key aspect today to understand
the functioning of value chains. Only then
can the challenges and the opportunities that
urbanization creates for agrifood systems
be clearly mapped onto appropriate policy,
technology and investment solutions.
Implementing these solutions requires that the
agrifood systems governance mechanisms and
institutions cross sectoral and administrative
boundaries and rely on subnational and local
governments. Local governments in particular are
fundamental actors in leveraging multilevel and
multistakeholder mechanisms that, as shown with
concrete examples in this report, have proved
effective in implementing essential policies and
solutions for making healthy diets available and
affordable for all. n

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
T his report regularly monitors global,
regional and national progress
towards the targets of ending both
hunger and food insecurity (Sustainable
Development Goal [SDG] Target 2.1) and all
forms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2) in the
context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development. This year, the global assessment
of the state of food security and nutrition in
2022 reflects a particular moment in history.
In 2022, the world was beginning to recover
from the COVID-19 pandemic when the war
broke out in Ukraine, shaking commodity and
energy markets. The pandemic, the ensuing
economic rebound, the war in Ukraine, and the
soaring prices of food, agricultural inputs and
energy due in part to the war have all played
out differently across regions and populations,
with differing impacts on hunger and food
insecurity. While new estimates presented in
Chapter 2 indicate hunger was no longer on the
rise at the global level in 2022, this indicator was
still far above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels.
Moreover, food crises were still unfolding in
many parts of the world. Many population
groups were not buoyed up by the economic
recovery or were bearing the brunt of higher
prices of food, inputs and energy – or both.
For these reasons, we are still far off track to
meet the SDG 2 targets.
Beyond the global assessment of food security
and nutrition in 2022, this report provides
in-depth analysis of the major drivers behind
these trends which are challenging our efforts
to achieve the SDGs in the context of the
2030 Agenda. Past editions have repeatedly
highlighted the intensification of the major
drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition –
conflict, climate extremes, economic slowdowns
and downturns, and growing inequality – often
occurring in combination, which have pushed
us off track to meet the SDG 2 targets. There
is no question these threats will continue,
requiring that we remain steadfast in taking
bold actions to build resilience against them.
However, there are still important megatrends
that must be factored into the analysis to fully
understand the challenges to and opportunities
for meeting the SDG 2 targets.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
The areas currently experiencing the most
rapid urbanization are those where the link
between urbanization, economic growth and
structural transformation is weaker – regions like
sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, which
have some of the highest numbers of individuals
who are hungry, food insecure and malnourished.
These two subregions are projected to experience
the most rapid increases in urbanization, while
at the same time facing the biggest challenges
regarding poverty, food insecurity and access to
affordable healthy diets. Sub-Saharan Africa’s
urban population is projected to almost quadruple
in size by 2050, reaching 1.3 billion, compared
with 306 million in 2010.4 At the same time, the
rural population is projected to increase less
rapidly but still profoundly, from 540 million in
2010 to 909 million in 2050. In Asia, the urban
population is projected to increase by 83 percent,
from 1.9 billion to 3.5 billion, while the rural
population is projected to decline by 540 million,
from 2.3 billion to 1.8 billion. But in Southern
Asia, the urban population is projected to more
than double, increasing by 120 percent, from
555 million to 1.3 billion.
Urbanization arises from a combination of
rural push factors (e.g. poverty, inequitable
land distribution, environmental degradation,
and forced displacement due to disasters or
conflict) and urban pull factors (e.g. urban
employment, higher wages, better social services
and educational opportunities), which vary
depending on the country and specific context.
This leads to increased food supply and demand,
direct and indirect land-use change, and more
complex agrifood market linkages among
producers, midstream supply chain processors
and distributors, and consumers.5 While living in
urban areas has often been associated with higher
standards of living overall, these areas may also
have pockets of abject poverty compared to rural
areas, and their services are often stretched to
the limit. This can result in lack of access to
affordable healthy diets, as well as increases in
poverty and food insecurity and multiple forms
of malnutrition.
Across the entire rural–urban continuum, the
majority of food consumed is purchased from
markets. Hence, the type of diet that households
consume is determined by cost and affordability,
One such megatrend, and the thematic focus of
this year’s report, is urbanization. As urbanization
increases, rural and urban areas are becoming
more intertwined, and the spatial distinction
between them is becoming more fluid. Population
growth in small and medium-sized cities
and rural towns now increasingly “bridges”
the space between the rural hinterland and
large metropolises.1, 2 The changing pattern
of population agglomerations across this
rural–urban continuum is driving changes
throughout agrifood systems, creating both
challenges and opportunities to ensure everyone
has access to affordable healthy diets. Overcoming
the challenges and leveraging the opportunities
will require actions and policy interventions
that are informed by a clear understanding of
how the rural–urban continuum and agrifood
systems interact.
While rates of urbanization vary across countries,
with the rate of any given country often linked
to its stage of structural transformation,
urbanization overall is accelerating. By 2050,
almost seven in ten people are projected to
live in cities; but even today this proportion is
already approximately 56 percent.a
 In low- and
middle-income countries, the urban population
is growing more than three times faster than the
rural population (3.08 percent compared with
0.89 percent annually, from 2015 to 2020).3
By 2030, the urban population in these countries
is projected to exceed 4 billion; that is, it will
have more than doubled in size since the year
2000. In contrast, the rural population of lowand middle-income countries is projected
to increase much less, to at least 3 billion by
2050 – only slightly higher than the 2.95 billion
figure of 2000. While rural populations are still
increasing rapidly in some regions such as the
African drylands, in most other regions rural
populations are declining, including in Latin
America and Europe.
a The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs
(UN DESA) does not apply its own definition of “urban” population, but
instead follows the definition used in each country. The definitions are
generally those used by national statistical offices in carrying out the
latest available census. Each country applies its own population criteria
for classifying cities as urban.3

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
which in turn depend on the structure of agrifood
systems, including food supply and value-added
chains. These factors must be taken into
consideration in designing effective policies and
investments to ensure rural, peri-urban and urban
populations have access to affordable healthy
diets. A policy approach that goes beyond sectoral
silos and administrative borders will be needed to
shape how regions urbanize and affect agrifood
systems across the rural–urban continuum.
After presenting the main trends in the global
assessment of food security and nutrition, and the
cost and affordability of a healthy diet around the
world (Chapter 2), this report explores the linkages
between urbanization and changing agrifood
systems across the rural–urban continuum.
To begin, Chapter 3 examines the drivers,
patterns and dynamics of urbanization through
a rural–urban continuum lens. It presents a
conceptual framework showing the pathways
through which urbanization is affecting agrifood
systems, and in turn enabling or hampering access
to affordable healthy diets, with implications for
food security and malnutrition in all its forms.
Looking at this process, one of the key transitions
that stands out occurs through the interplay of
food supply and demand, as well as the resulting
changes in what people are eating across the
rural–urban continuum. To better understand
this, Chapter 4 presents new analysis precisely
on how urbanization is changing food demand,
utilizing a unique Urban Rural Catchment
Areas (URCA) global dataset combined with
georeferenced household survey data. This is
followed by additional analysis for selected
countries exploring differences in the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet, and in food
insecurity and different forms of malnutrition
across the rural–urban continuum.
Finally, building on the insights from the
previous chapters, Chapter 5 identifies the
policies, new technologies, and associated
investments that can be adapted to address the
challenges – and capitalize on the opportunities –
that urbanization brings for ensuring access to
affordable healthy diets for everyone, across the
rural–urban continuum. The chapter describes
the governance mechanisms and institutions
that are needed to achieve a more coherent and
integrated approach for implementing these
policies and solutions.
Such timely evidence and recommendations are
relevant to the New Urban Agenda, endorsed
by the United Nations General Assembly in
2016, as well as other global processes such as
the United Nations Food Systems Summit and
the establishment of the Urban Food Systems
Coalition in 2021. They are also considered
highly relevant for the efforts towards achieving
SDGs beyond Zero Hunger, not least SDG 11
(Sustainable Cities and Communities), but also
SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and
Well-being), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities)
and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption
and Production). n

CHAPTER 2
FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
AROUND THE
WORLD
T he global assessment of the state of
food security and nutrition in 2022
presented in this edition of the report
is a snapshot of the world still recovering from
a global pandemic and now grappling with the
consequences of the war in Ukraine, which has
further rattled food and energy markets. The
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lives and
livelihoods was devastating, producing a global
economic recession that ended three decades of
global progress in poverty reduction, contributing
to an estimated increase of close to 90 million
people facing hunger in just one year (from 2019
to 2020). The year 2021 marked a partial recovery
from the pandemic-induced contractions that
was highly uneven, across countries and within
countries; the pace of recovery was much slower
in low- and lower-middle-income countries,
and disadvantaged segments of the population
everywhere were still struggling to recover from
the income losses suffered during the peak of
the pandemic the previous year. This contributed
to a further increase of about 38 million in the
estimated number of people experiencing hunger
in 2021. In February 2022, just as the weight of
the pandemic was beginning to lift, the war in
Ukraine erupted involving two major producers
of agricultural commodities in the world, sending
shockwaves through commodity and energy
markets, weakening the recovery and adding even
greater uncertainty.1
It is in this context of continued slow and
uneven recovery from the pandemic and global
repercussions of the war in Ukraine that this
assessment of the state of food security and
nutrition in 2022 is presented. Encouraging signs
of economic recovery from the pandemic and
projections of a decline in poverty and hunger
have been tempered by rising prices of food,
agricultural inputs and energy.
This chapter presents an annual update of the
global assessment of food security and nutrition
up to the year 2022 and a report on progress
towards meeting Sustainable Development
Goal (SDG) 2 with a special focus on SDG
Targets 2.1 and 2.2: end hunger and ensure access
by all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food all year round; and end all forms of
malnutrition by 2030.
Section 2.1 presents an assessment of progress
towards achieving the SDG 2 targets for hunger
and food insecurity. It includes global, regional
and subregional updates of the two Target 2.1
indicators: the prevalence of undernourishment
(PoU) and the prevalence of moderate or severe
food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity
Experience Scale (FIES), revised up to 2022 based
on the most recent data available to FAO at the
time of writing this report. Updated projections
of what the global PoU may be in 2030 are also
provided. A comparison of the food insecurity
status of men and women is presented, as well
as, for the first time, a look at differences in
food insecurity among rural, peri-urban and
urban populations.
Section 2.2 presents updated estimates of the
indicators of the cost and affordability of a
healthy diet (CoAHD). These indicators provide

recovery of employment and incomes of the most
vulnerable people, hindering a decline in hunger.
è The relative lack of change in hunger between
2021 and 2022 at the global level hides substantial
differences at the regional and subregional levels.
While progress was made towards reducing hunger in
Asia and in Latin America, hunger was still on the rise
in Western Asia, the Caribbean and all subregions
of Africa.
è The PoU in Africa rose from 19.4 percent in 2021
to 19.7 percent in 2022, driven mostly by increases in
Northern and Southern Africa. The number of people
facing hunger in Africa has increased by 11 million
people since 2021 and by more than 57 million people
since the outbreak of the pandemic.
è The PoU in Asia fell from 8.8 percent in 2021
to 8.5 percent in 2022 – a decrease of more
than 12 million people, mostly in Southern Asia.
However, this is still 58 million above pre-pandemic
levels. There were improvements in every subregion
except Western Asia, where the PoU increased from
10.2 percent in 2021 to 10.8 percent in 2022.
è A turnaround also occurred in Latin America and
the Caribbean, where the PoU fell from 7.0 percent
in 2021 to 6.5 percent in 2022 – a decrease of
2.4 million in the number of people facing hunger,
but still 7.2 million more than in 2019. The decrease
was driven by South America and masks a notable
increase in the Caribbean, from 14.7 percent in 2021
to 16.3 percent in 2022.
è A much larger proportion of the population in
Africa faces hunger compared to the other regions
of the world – nearly 20 percent compared with
8.5 percent in Asia, 6.5 percent in Latin America and
the Caribbean, and 7.0 percent in Oceania.
è It is projected that almost 600 million people will
be chronically undernourished in 2030, pointing to
the immense challenge of achieving the SDG target
to eradicate hunger. This is about 119 million more
than in a scenario in which neither the pandemic
nor the war in Ukraine had occurred, and around
23 million more than if the war in Ukraine had not
happened. Most progress is expected to occur in Asia,
whereas no progress is foreseen in Latin America and
the Caribbean, and hunger is projected to increase
significantly in Africa by 2030.
evidence regarding people’s economic access to
diverse, nutritious foods, which is one critical
aspect of achieving healthy diets. In this year’s
edition of the report, the cost and affordability
indicators are updated to 2021. Lack of recent data
on estimated income distributions, purchasing
power parities (PPPs), and detailed food prices at
the country level prevents an update to 2022.
Section 2.3 presents an assessment of the state
of nutrition and progress towards the global
nutrition targets defined by the World Health
Assembly (WHA) in 2012 and the 2030 Agenda
for Sustainable Development (SDG 2.2). Updates
are provided for five nutrition targets: low
birthweight, exclusive breastfeeding, and
stunting, wasting and overweight in children
under five years of age.

KEY MESSAGES
è Global hunger, measured by the prevalence
of undernourishment (PoU) (SDG Indicator 2.1.1),
remained relatively unchanged from 2021 to 2022
but is still far above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels,
affecting around 9.2 percent of the world population
in 2022 compared with 7.9 percent in 2019.
è It is estimated that between 691 and 783 million
people in the world faced hunger in 2022.
Considering the midrange (about 735 million),
122 million more people faced hunger in 2022 than in
2019, before the pandemic.
è The economic recovery from the pandemic
observed in 2021 slowed in 2022. Rising prices of
food, agricultural inputs and energy, magnified by
the impact of the war in Ukraine, undermined the

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
è Following a sharp increase from 2019 to 2020,
the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
at the global level (SDG Indicator 2.1.2) remained
unchanged for the second year in a row but was still
far above the pre-pandemic level of 25.3 percent.
About 29.6 percent of the global population –
2.4 billion people – were moderately or severely food
insecure in 2022, 391 million more than in 2019.
è The prevalence of severe food insecurity at
the global level declined slightly from 11.7 percent
in 2021 to 11.3 percent in 2022, the equivalent
of 27 million fewer people. However, the number
of severely food-insecure people was still about
900 million in 2022, which is 180 million more than
in 2019.
è The prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity rose slightly in Africa and in Northern
America and Europe, and decreased non-significantly
in Asia from 2021 to 2022. The only region showing
encouraging progress is Latin America and the
Caribbean, where moderate or severe food insecurity
decreased from 40.3 percent in 2021 to 37.5 percent
in 2022, the equivalent of 16.5 million fewer people in
one year, mainly in South America.
è A comparison of food insecurity among rural,
peri-urban and urban populations reveals that global
food insecurity, at both levels of severity, is lower
in urban areas. Moderate or severe food insecurity
affected 33.3 percent of adults living in rural areas in
2022 compared with 28.8 percent in peri-urban areas
and 26.0 percent in urban areas.
è Food insecurity affects women more than men in
every region of the world. However, the gender gap in
food insecurity at the global level, which had widened
in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, narrowed
from 3.8 percentage points in 2021 to 2.4 percentage
points in 2022, suggesting that the disproportionate
impacts of the pandemic on women’s food insecurity
have eased globally and in some regions. The gender
gap diminished notably in Asia and in Latin America
and the Caribbean, but widened in Africa and in
Northern America and Europe.
Estimates of how many people are facing
hunger in the world are always the best possible
approximations given the information available.
The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted normal data
collection activities in 2020 and 2021, creating
additional challenges for the assessment of the
state of food insecurity in the world and inducing
greater uncertainty around the estimates. While
the main effects of the pandemic have receded,
and data collection activities have begun to
normalize, data reporting by countries was
still not fully back up to speed by 2022. Thus,
estimates of the global PoU (SDG Indicator 2.1.1)
are presented as ranges beginning in
2020 to reflect the additional uncertainty
since the pandemic.
As always, the PoU estimates for the most recent
year (2022) are obtained by nowcasting the values
of the three needed parameters using the most
recent information available to FAO regarding the
food supply and based on reasonable assumptions
on the extent of inequality in access to food
(Annex 2, Section A).
The assessments of the prevalence of moderate
or severe food insecurity based on the FIES
(SDG Indicator 2.1.2) are informed by official
estimates as reported by countries, whenever
available, and by FAO estimates based on
data collected annually by the Organization
through data collection service providers in over
140 different countries (see Annex 1B).
SDG Indicator 2.1.1
Prevalence of undernourishment
The assessment of global hunger in 2022,
measured by the PoU (SDG Indicator 2.1.1), reveals
that it remained far above pre-pandemic levels.
The proportion of the world population facing
chronic hunger in 2022 was about 9.2 percent,
compared with 7.9 percent in 2019 (Figure 1). After
increasing sharply in 2020 in the midst of the
global pandemic, and rising more slowly in
2021 to 9.3 percent, the PoU ceased to increase
from 2021 to 2022, providing some hope of a
possible turnaround.b
It is estimated that hunger affected between
691 and 783 million people in the world in 2022.
b The entire series of PoU values is revised with each new edition of
this report to reflect new data and information that FAO has obtained
since the release of the previous edition. As this process usually implies
backward revisions of the entire PoU series, readers should refrain from
comparing series across different editions of this report and should
always refer to the current edition, including for values in past years.

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
Considering the projected midrange (about
735 million in 2022), 122 million more people faced
hunger in 2022 than in 2019, before the pandemic.
The relative lack of change in hunger at the
global level from 2021 to 2022 hides substantial
differences at the regional level (Table 1, Table 2 and
Figure 2). Many places in the world are still facing
serious food crises (Box 1). Hunger has been on the
rise in Africa since 2010, with a sharp increase in
all subregions in 2020 followed by a gentler rise
in 2021. In 2022, the PoU in Africa continued to
rise from 19.4 percent in 2021 to 19.7 percent – the
equivalent of 11 million more people in one year
and nearly 57 million more since the outbreak
of the pandemic. Moreover, hunger increased
throughout all subregions of Africa in 2022. The
PoU in Northern Africa rose from 6.9 percent to
7.5 percent, equivalent to nearly 2 million more
people facing hunger in 2022. In sub-Saharan
Africa, hunger increased from 22.2 percent to
22.5 percent, which translates into 9 million more
people compared to 2021. The largest increase in
PoU occurred in Southern Africa, at 1.1 percentage
points, followed by Middle Africa with an
increase of 0.6 percentage points. Marginal
increases of 0.1 percentage points occurred in
Western and Eastern Africa from 2021 to 2022.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
In terms of numbers of people facing hunger,
these percentage-point increases are equivalent
to about 1 million more people in Southern
Africa, 3 million more in Middle Africa and also
in Eastern Africa, and 2 million more in Western
Africa. All subregions in Africa registered either a
prevalence or a number of undernourished people
well above pre-pandemic levels.
The PoU estimate for Asia for 2022 points to a
turnaround in the trend of hunger, which had
been on the rise in the region since 2017.
The PoU fell from 8.8 percent in 2021 to
8.5 percent in 2022 – a decrease of more
than 12 million people, mostly in Southern
Asia. However, this is still 58 million above
pre-pandemic levels. Every subregion except
Western Asia experienced a turnaround, with
the largest improvement in Southern Asia, the
subregion with the highest PoU (15.6 percent
in 2022). In Western Asia, more than 2 million
additional people were facing hunger in 2022
compared to 2021 – an increase of 0.6 percentage
points, from 10.2 percent to 10.8 percent.
A turnaround also occurred in Latin America
and the Caribbean, where the PoU fell from
7.0 percent in 2021 to 6.5 percent in 2022 –

a decrease of more than 2.4 million in the
number of people facing hunger, though still
7.2 million more compared to 2019. There was
a sharp increase in the Caribbean subregion
from 14.7 percent in 2021 to 16.3 percent in 2022.
However, notable improvements occurred in
South America in the same period, where the
PoU decreased from 7.0 percent to 6.1 percent,
equivalent to 3.5 million people, but still
6 million above 2019 levels.
The proportion of the population facing hunger
is much larger in Africa compared to the other
regions of the world – nearly 20 percent compared
with 8.5 percent in Asia, 6.5 percent in Latin
America and the Caribbean, and 7.0 percent in
Oceania (Table 1).
While the regional prevalence estimates reveal
the magnitude of the burden of hunger in each
region, converting them into numbers of people
indicates where most of the people facing hunger
in the world live (Table 2 and Figure 3). While the
PoU in Asia is less than half that in Africa,
Asia is nevertheless home to the majority of
people facing hunger – 402 million, representing

Economic recovery hampered by new challenges
to food security
At the end of 2021, global food security was on
high alert due to lingering effects of the COVID-19
pandemic as well as new and ongoing conflicts
and weather-related shocks. A combination of
an unequal economic recovery after a dramatic
decrease in economic activity observed in
2020, and rising food, fuel and transportation
prices produced by the recovery itself, thwarted
progress in food security.
Just as global economic conditions appeared to
be more favourable for 2022 and the prospects
of a reduction in hunger and food insecurity
towards pre-pandemic levels seemed possible,
the outbreak of the war in Ukraine sent another
shock through the global economy. As a result,

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
the recovery observed in 2021 slowed further in
2022 and global gross domestic product (GDP)
grew in 2022 by 3.4 percent, one percentage
point more slowly than predicted at the
beginning of 2023.3
The shock caused by the war acted mainly
through the global food and agricultural
markets, as it involved two major global
producers of agricultural commodities: the
Russian Federation and Ukraine. In 2021, either
the Russian Federation or Ukraine (or both)
ranked among the top three global exporters of
wheat, maize, rapeseed, cake of sunflower seed,
and sunflower oil.c, 4 The Russian Federation is
also a prominent exporter of fertilizers. In this
context, one of the main impacts of the war has
been to increase international prices of food.
c The two countries combined accounted for 19 percent of global
output of barley, 14 percent of wheat, and 4 percent of maize,
between 2016/17 and 2020/21. Their contribution to the global
production of oilseeds was particularly important for sunflower oil,
with just over half of world output, on average, originating in the two
countries during this period.
Although global food commodity prices were
rising steadily even before the war, the added
uncertainty induced by the war contributed
to a surge in food prices. The FAO Food Price
Index jumped to an all-time high in March
2022, and although the index steadily declined
throughout the year, it remained much higher
than before the pandemic.5 As a result of the
high international food prices, import costs of
food rose, affecting especially countries that are
highly dependent on food imports. The world
food import bill was estimated to have reached
an all-time high in 2022 of nearly USD 2 trillion,
an increase of 10 percent (nearly USD 181 billion)
from the 2021 level, driven mostly by higher
prices.6 World fertilizer prices also soared,
mainly as a result of rising energy and natural
gas prices. The global agricultural input import
bill was estimated to increase by 48 percent in
2022 to USD 424 billion.7 All of these factors
have contributed to higher prices of food at the
local and national levels, which in turn have
contributed heavily to overall inflation. Inflation
rose throughout 2022 in almost all economies,

and global headline inflation exceeded 9 percent
in the second half of the year, the highest
level since 1995.8
In this context, global trends in hunger reflect
the combination of two factors interplaying
at the household level. First, an income effect
produced by the economic recovery in 2022
likely contributed to an increase in household
disposable income and improved access to
food, particularly for the poorest households
that suffered heavy income losses during the
pandemic. Globally, employment increased by
2.3 percent in 2022 from a meagre annual growth
of 0.2 percent in the period from 2020 to 2021.9
Employment growth was faster in low-income
countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income
countries (LMICs) than in upper-middle-income
countries (UMICs) and high-income countries
(HICs). Concomitantly, global unemployment
declined significantly in 2022 to 205 million,
down from 216 million in 2021 and 235 million in
2020, but still above its 2019 level.9
The second factor affecting the trend in hunger
is the price effect. Increases in food prices and
general inflation can erode income gains and
worsen access to food. In the short term, this
is particularly true for the poorest segments
of the population who spend a larger share of
their income on food. In the long term, however,
some households may manage to adapt their
consumption patterns to lessen the impacts,
and poor rural populations engaged in

agriculture may even benefit from higher prices
for their agricultural products.d, 10
d Poverty assessments conducted during the food price crises of
2008 and 2011 demonstrated that higher food prices have the potential
to boost agricultural income growth and wages.10
The stalled situation in global hunger observed
for 2022 is thus the result of the interaction
of these two factors. The economic recovery
helped to stem the rising tide of hunger at
least at the global level. However, the positive
effect could have been even greater without
the countervailing winds caused by the global
 BOX 1 HOW DOES THE EVIDENCE ON CHRONIC FOOD INSECURITY ALIGN WITH THE EVIDENCE ON ACUTE
FOOD INSECURITY IN FOOD CRISIS COUNTRIES?
The evidence presented in this report points to the fact
that, although the prevalence of undernourishment
(PoU) at the global level remained relatively unchanged
from 2021 to 2022, hunger was on the rise in many
parts of the world. The negative impacts on food
security of the war in Ukraine (and other conflicts),
soaring food prices and extreme weather events were
felt more strongly in some places than in others.
Consistent with this, the most recent edition of the
Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)2 reinforces
these conclusions.
The GRFC and this report are both multipartnership
efforts that provide international assessments of food
security; however, their objectives and geographical
scope are distinct, and they rely on different data and
methodologies. On the one hand, this report has the
broad objective of monitoring chronic food insecurity
in the entire world, on a regular basis, by reporting
on SDG Indicators 2.1.1 and 2.1.2. Chronic food
insecurity is defined as a structural, long-term situation
of food deprivation. The PoU, for example, measures
hunger (chronic undernourishment) defined as the
long-term or persistent inability to meet minimum
dietary energy requirements and, within a country,
it is estimated to be representative of the whole
population. The GRFC, on the other hand, focuses
more narrowly on acute food insecurity in countries
experiencing food crises for the purpose of guiding
immediate humanitarian response. Acute food
insecurity refers to a short-term (possibly temporary)
inability to meet dietary energy requirements, related
to sporadic crises that may sometimes be protracted
and are of a severity that threatens lives or livelihoods.
Assessments of food insecurity prioritize the use of
the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification/
Cadre Harmonisé (IPC/CH), applied in a set of
countries that are susceptible to food crisis situations
and, therefore, potentially in need of humanitarian
assistance.* These assessments are not statistical
measurements, but rather the result of a process
of convergence of evidence reached by a country
team of analysts, based on the most recent available
information from various sources. Within a country,
rough estimates of the number of people facing crisis
levels of acute food insecurity are presented that refer
to the specific populations covered by the analysis,
and not necessarily to the whole population at the
national level.
Because of these conceptual and measurement
differences, a direct comparison of figures from
both reports is not possible. However, acute and
chronic food insecurity are not unrelated phenomena.
Repeated shocks and persistent crises can provoke
situations of chronic food insecurity. Because of this,
one expects some alignment, at least in trends, of the
results of the two reports.
Having this in mind, the 2023 GRFC2 points to an
increase of around 37 million people facing acute food
insecurity (IPC/CH Phase 3 or above) from 2021 to
2022 in the same 48 countries analysed in both years.**
That is equivalent to an increase in the prevalence of
acute food insecurity from 21.8 percent to 22.5 percent
of the analysed population. An analysis of hunger (PoU)
restricted to the same group of 48 countries analysed
by the GRFC shows an increase of 14 million in the
number of people facing chronic undernourishment,
equivalent to an increase in the PoU from 20.8 percent
to 21.3 percent of the combined populations of those
48 countries (Figure A). This reveals convergence in the
assessments of the trends and points to the existence
of persistent food crises in many parts of the world,
reinforcing the need to better understand the nexus
between acute and chronic food insecurity, particularly
in food crisis countries.
NOTES: * When recent IPC/CH is not available, alternative sources are used such as the Consolidated Approach for Reporting Indicators of Food Security
or the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. These are used to approximate populations facing crisis or worse (IPC/CH 3+).
** In the 48 countries analysed in both years in the GRFC, there were differences in analysis coverage at the country level, resulting in a 15.5 percent
increase in the analysed population between the two years in these countries.

repercussions of the war in Ukraine and the price
inflation for food, agricultural inputs and energy,
together with other drivers of food insecurity
such as conflicts and weather-related events.
As a result, hunger remains far above
pre-pandemic levels globally and in all regions.
At the regional level, this dynamic of income
and price effect is visible in multiple subregions,
with varying results. In Southern Africa, for
instance, the uptick of hunger in 2022 stemmed
from increasing inflation, following the upsurge
in international commodity prices, as well as
domestic challenges such as persistently high
levels of unemployment and vulnerability to
shocks.11 Although there was sustained GDP
growth in 2022, this often did not translate into
improved socioeconomic conditions for the
poor. Agricultural production, at the same time,
suffered from severe droughts and floods, and the
surge in international fertilizer prices. In Middle
Africa, the increase in hunger has mainly resulted
from food inflation and increasing food import
bills, as well as extreme climate events, which
have counteracted the positive effects of economic
growth, driven by buoyant oil export revenues in
some countries.11
In Western Asia, many countries benefited from
increased oil revenues, but these did not always
translate into lower levels of hunger in 2022.
Political instability in some countries and conflicts
have continued to disrupt food supplies, markets
and distribution systems, resulting in higher food
prices and food shortages. In addition, domestic
inflation has soared in several countries, making
access to food more difficult.12 In Southern Asia,
on the other hand, the outcome of sustained
economic growth, especially in agriculture, has
likely prevailed over inflation, thus contributing
to an overall improvement in food security
conditions. More than one country in the region
has also enacted policy measures that have
contributed to this overall improvement, including

supplying fertilizers to farmers, providing cereal
subsidies to vulnerable population groups, and
reducing customs duties on imported cereals.13
In the Caribbean, more than one small island
developing state has suffered from high food
inflation and increased import bills, given the
widespread dependence of the subregion on
imported food and agricultural products. At the
same time, export revenues have been declining
in key sectors, including tourism, resulting
in reduced disposable income and increased
food insecurity.14 On the contrary, the observed
decline in hunger in 2022 in South America, a
net exporter of food and agricultural products,
stemmed largely from positive development in
labour markets, which counteracted the surge
in inflation, as well as from social protection
policies.14 Additionally, some countries in the
region have benefited from the surge in oil and
gas prices that boosted export revenues. This has
translated into improved public budget resources
(which could be used to finance social protection
programmes) and investment in agriculture and
food distribution systems.
At the country level, these countervailing forces
have played out in different ways with unequal
impacts on trends in hunger. A comparison
across country income groups of changes in
the PoU between 2019 and 2022 shows that
LICs are still struggling the most to recover.
Globally, 58 percent of countries had a PoU in
2022 that was still above pre-pandemic levels.
However, the percentage is much higher in LICs;
77 percent of LICs have not returned to PoU
levels observed in 2019, in contrast to 47 percent
of UMICs (Figure 4).
The halt in the rise in global hunger observed in
2022 is also consistent with nowcasts of poverty
available for 2022.10 Projections for 2022 are that,
despite an expected reduction in poverty between
2021 and 2022, the pace of reduction will further
stall given the downward revised prospects of
global growth in 2022 and higher prices of food,
agricultural inputs and energy. It is estimated
that the number of people in extreme poverty will
have decreased by 5 million from 2021 to 2022,
based on a scenario that takes into consideration
the relatively greater impact of high food
inflation among the poor.
Towards ending hunger (SDG Target 2.1):
projections to 2030
As in previous editions of the report, an
exercise was conducted to project how many
people may be facing hunger in 2030 based on
what can be inferred from available forecasts
of fundamental demographic and economic
variables. The projections were obtained by
separately projecting each of the parameters
that inform the model used to estimate the PoU
(see Annex 2, Section B).
Trajectories are presented under three scenarios:
“current prospects”, which aims to capture
current projections of the PoU in 2030 based on
the world economic prospects presented in the
April 2023 edition of the International Monetary
Fund World Economic Outlook database;3
“projections before COVID-19”, calibrated to
reflect the situation of the world economy
before the pandemic, as described by the World
Economic Outlook published in October 2019;15
and “projections before the war in Ukraine”,
which does the same but considering the October
2021 edition of the same publication16 before the
outbreak of the war.
The current scenario shows that almost
600 million people will be chronically
undernourished in 2030, pointing to the
immense challenge of achieving the SDG
target to eradicate hunger (Figure 5). This is
about 119 million more undernourished people
than in the scenario in which neither the
pandemic nor the war in Ukraine had occurred
(the “projections before COVID-19” scenario)
and around 23 million more than in the
scenario where the war had not happened (the
“projections before the war in Ukraine” scenario).
The latter provides an indication of the additional
setback the war may have caused in the global
fight against hunger.
Figure 5 also shows how the situation is currently
expected to evolve in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America and the Caribbean. The different
trajectories are evident, demonstrating that
practically all the progress in the fight against
hunger is expected to be made in Asia, where
the number of undernourished is projected to
fall from the current 402 million to 242 million
people by 2030. The number of undernourished

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
is expected to remain constant in Latin America
and the Caribbean and to increase significantly
in Africa, where it is projected that close to
300 million people may be facing hunger in 2030.
Much stronger efforts are needed to address the
fundamental structural problems that afflict the
African continent.
SDG Indicator 2.1.2
Prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity in the population, based on the
Food Insecurity Experience Scale
SDG Target 2.1 challenges the world not only to
end hunger, but also to work to ensure access
for all people to safe, nutritious and sufficient
food all year round. SDG Indicator 2.1.2 – the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
in the population, based on the FIES – tracks
progress towards this ambitious goal.
New estimates of the prevalence of food
insecurity based on the FIES confirm that for
2022 no progress was made on food insecurity
at the global level. Following a sharp increase
from 2019 to 2020, the global prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity remained
unchanged for the second year in a row, far
above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels (Figure 6
and Table 3). In 2022, an estimated 29.6 percent of
the global population – 2.4 billion people – were
moderately or severely food insecure, meaning
they did not have access to adequate food (Table 3
and Table 4). This is still 391 million more people
than in 2019, before the pandemic, and 745 million
more compared to 2015 when the 2030 Sustainable
Development Agenda was launched.
More than one-third (38 percent) of people
facing moderate or severe food insecurity in the
world in 2022 – over 900 million – were severely
food insecure, indicating that they had run out
of food at times during the year and, at worst,
gone an entire day or more without eating. The
prevalence of severe food insecurity at the global
level showed a marginal decline from 11.7 percent
in 2021 to 11.3 percent in 2022, the equivalent of
27 million fewer people (Figure 6, Table 3 and Table 4).
While it is encouraging that the upward trend in
severe food insecurity of the past six years has not
continued, the global prevalence is still far above
pre-pandemic levels – equivalent to 180 million
more people compared to 2019 (Table 3 and Table 4).
At the global level, the slight decrease in severe
food insecurity, and unchanged prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity, suggest that
the gravity of the food insecurity situation of
some people may have transitioned from severe to
moderate from 2021 to 2022.
As expected, the global trends in the prevalence
of severe food insecurity are similar to the
trends for the PoU (Table 1). This is because people
experiencing severe food insecurity are unlikely
to be able to acquire enough food to continuously
fulfil their dietary energy requirements, and
thus may become chronically undernourished.
Both indicators provide evidence regarding
the proportion of the population facing severe
constraints on food access, albeit based on very
different methodologies and sources of data
(see Annex 1B).
Despite the lack of change in the prevalence
of food insecurity at the global level, there
were divergent trends at the regional level.
Improvements in some regions were offset
by worsening situations in others (Figure 6,
Table 3 and Table 4).
The prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity in Africa increased by one percentage
point in one year to 60.9 percent in 2022.
The increase is much smaller compared to the
previous year, when it rose by 4 percentage points.
From 2021 to 2022, the prevalence of moderate
or severe food insecurity rose in Eastern Africa,
Middle Africa and Southern Africa by 2.4, 3.0 and
1.2 percentage points, respectively. The prevalence
in 2022 ranged from 25.9 percent in Southern
Africa to 78.4 percent in Middle Africa. The
increase in moderate or severe food insecurity
in Africa from 2021 to 2022 is mostly due to
more people facing moderate food insecurity, as
the rise in severe food insecurity in the region
was marginal. Nevertheless, nearly one in four
people in Africa (24.0 percent) was facing severe
food insecurity in 2022. The prevalence of severe
food insecurity rose in Northern Africa, Middle
Africa, Southern Africa and Western Africa by
0.8, 1.3, 1.5 and 0.3 percentage points, respectively
– the equivalent of 2.4 million more people in
Northern Africa, 4.8 million more in Middle

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Africa, 1.1 million more in Southern Africa, and
3.6 million more in Western Africa facing severe
food insecurity in 2022 compared to 2021.
A non-significant decrease in food insecurity
was registered in Asia, where 24.2 percent of the
population was facing moderate or severe food
insecurity in 2022 compared with 24.5 percent
in 2021. The situation improved somewhat
in Central Asia and Western Asia, where the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
fell by 2.7 and 3.2 percentage points, respectively,
even as severe food insecurity increased
slightly in Western Asia. Moderate or severe
food insecurity remained virtually unchanged
in the other subregions of Asia, although
there are still large differences in prevalence
between subregions. The percentage of people
facing moderate or severe food insecurity
ranged from 6.2 percent in Eastern Asia to
40.3 percent in Southern Asia, which is home to
more than one-third of the world’s moderately
or severely food-insecure population – about
809 million people. Southern Asia also has the
highest prevalence of severe food insecurity
on the continent, although this did decrease

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
by 1.6 percentage points from 2021 to 2022,
the equivalent of 28.7 million people.
Latin America and the Caribbean showed
encouraging progress in 2022, as the proportion
of the population facing moderate or severe food
insecurity decreased from 40.3 percent in 2021 to
37.5 percent in 2022, the equivalent of 16.5 million
fewer people in one year. The improvement was
driven by a decrease in South America, from
40.9 percent in 2021 to 36.4 percent in 2022.
The prevalence of severe food insecurity also
declined in South America, from 15.1 percent in
2021 to 12.7 percent in 2022. In Central America
and the Caribbean, on the other hand, the food
security situation deteriorated from 2021 to 2022.
In the Caribbean, which is the subregion most
affected by food insecurity, the prevalence of
moderate or severe food insecurity increased
from 59.5 percent to 60.6 percent, and severe
food insecurity increased from 25.7 percent
to 28.2 percent.
In Oceania, the prevalence of moderate or severe
food insecurity was 13.0 percent in 2022.
An estimated 3.4 percent of the population in
Oceania was facing severe food insecurity in 2022,
down from 4.5 percent in 2021.
In Northern America and Europe, the prevalence
of moderate or severe food insecurity rose slightly
in 2022 to 8.0 percent, while severe food insecurity
remained unchanged. Moderate or severe food
insecurity increased by approximately 2 percentage
points in Northern Europe, reaching 6.6 percent in
2022, whereas the prevalence of moderate or severe
food insecurity decreased by about 1 percentage
point in Southern Europe to 7.5 percent.
It is interesting to compare how the regions
have fared in the fight against hunger since
the pandemic emerged in late 2019. Three
years later, parts of Asia and Latin America
appear to be rebounding, whereas Africa is still
struggling to turn things around. Regardless,
food insecurity levels in all regions are still far
above pre-pandemic levels.
Figure 7 shows that, of a total of 2.4 billion people
in the world facing food insecurity in 2022,
nearly half (1.1 billion) were in Asia; 37 percent
(868 million) were in Africa; 10.5 percent
(248 million) lived in Latin America and the
Caribbean; and around 4 percent (90 million)
were in Northern America and Europe. The
figure also illustrates the different proportions
of severe food insecurity in relation to moderate
or severe food insecurity across regions. Severe
food insecurity represents a larger share of the
combined total of moderate plus severe food
insecurity in Africa, Asia, and Latin America
and the Caribbean – 39.4 percent, 39.9 percent
and 33.5 percent, respectively – compared with
18.8 percent in Northern America and Europe.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Differences in food insecurity across rural,
peri-urban and urban areas
The availability of georeferenced FIES data
collected by FAO in 2022 has made it possible
to present, for the first time, a comparison
of food insecurity in rural, peri-urban and
urban populations at the global, regional and
subregional levels.e
 The Degree of Urbanization
(DEGURBA) classification, a new international
standard, was used to distinguish among
populations living in: i) rural areas; ii) towns
and semi-dense areas (peri-urban areas); and
e See Annex 2, Section C for details on the methods used to obtain
disaggregated estimates.
iii) cities (urban areas), based on population
density and size, in a globally comparable way.f, 17
The prevalence of food insecurity among adults
within each group was then calculated.
Results show that at the global level, food security
improves as the degree of urbanization increases
f The DEGURBA classification was developed by the Statistical Office
of the European Union (EUROSTAT), the International Labour
Organization (ILO), FAO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development (OECD), the United Nations Human Settlements
Programme (UN-Habitat) and the World Bank and was approved at the
51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020 (see Box 2
in Chapter 3).17 This differs from the Urban Rural Catchment Areas
(URCA) criteria used for the analyses of subsets of countries in
Chapter 4 (see Box 3).

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
(Figure 8).g
 Moderate or severe food insecurity
affected 33.3 percent of adults living in rural
areas in 2022 compared with 28.8 percent in
peri-urban areas and 26.0 percent in urban areas.
The prevalence of severe food insecurity was
12.8 percent in rural areas, 11.6 percent among
peri-urban residents, and 9.4 percent among
urban residents.
At the regional level, the differences across
regions are interesting. Africa clearly follows the
global pattern of worsening food security when

insecurity, and severe food insecurity only, by degree of urbanization in
2022 by region and subregion.
moving from urban, to peri-urban, to rural areas.
In Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean,
food insecurity is significantly higher in rural
areas compared to urban areas, at both levels of
severity, but the differences between peri-urban
and rural areas are less clear. In Northern
America and Europe, on the other hand, food
insecurity, at both levels of severity is worse in
urban areas than in rural areas.
These differences in regional patterns may be
partially explained by looking at rural–urban
differences in food insecurity by DEGURBA
through a country income group lens (Figure 8).

are more food insecure compared to urban
populations, whereas in LMICs, food insecurity is
highest in rural areas but only marginally worse
in peri-urban than in urban areas. The situation
is markedly different in UMICs and HICs. Among
UMICs, the prevalence of food insecurity, at both
levels of severity, is highest in rural areas and
lowest in peri-urban areas. In HICs, on the other
hand, it is the urban population that is at higher
risk of moderate or severe food insecurity, with
virtually no difference for severe food insecurity.
Gender differences in food insecurity
Persistent gender inequalities are revealed by the
new FIES data. Food insecurity is more prevalent
among adult women than men in every region of
the world. The gender gap in food insecurity at the
global level widened considerably in 2020 and 2021
in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as women
were more affected by job and income losses and
bore a larger responsibility for additional, unpaid
caregiving duties.18, 19 Women living in rural areas
were even more likely to be food insecure,20 as job
and income losses were much higher for women
than for men particularly in agrifood systems.21
In 2021, the gender gap reached 3.8 percentage
points, with 28.6 percent of women in the world
being moderately or severely food insecure
compared with 24.8 percent of men (Figure 9).
For 2022, the food insecurity gap between men and
women appears to have narrowed considerably
at the global level, which may partially reflect
a return of women to economic activities as
pandemic-related restrictions were eased, and a
weakening of the disproportionate impacts of the
pandemic on women’s food insecurity. In 2022,
27.8 percent of adult women were moderately or
severely food insecure, compared with 25.4 percent
of men, and the proportion of women facing severe
food insecurity was 10.6 percent compared with
9.5 percent of men. The difference in the prevalence
of moderate or severe food insecurity between
men and women decreased from 3.8 percentage
points in 2021 to 2.4 percentage points in 2022, and
the gap for severe food insecurity narrowed from
2.4 to 1.1 percentage points (Figure 9).h
h See Table A1.4 in Annex 1A for prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity, and severe food insecurity only, among adult men and
women in 2022 by region and subregion. See Annex 2, Section C for the
methodology.
There were encouraging improvements in the
gender gap in both Asia and Latin America
and the Caribbean from 2021 to 2022. The gap
narrowed by more than 2 percentage points
for moderate or severe food insecurity in both
regions, and by about 2 and 1.3 percentage points
for severe food insecurity in Asia and in Latin
America and the Caribbean, respectively.
In Africa and in Northern America and Europe,
however, the gap increased marginally for
moderate or severe food insecurity and remained
about the same for severe food insecurity. n

COST AND AFFORDABILITY
OF A HEALTHY DIET
KEY MESSAGES
è The cost of a healthy diet rose globally by 4.3 percent
in comparison to 2020, and by 6.7 percent compared to
the pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels, in 2019. This increase
is due to the overall rise in inflation in 2020 and 2021,
driven in part by the persisting effects of the pandemic.
è Worldwide in 2021, the average cost of a healthy
diet was 3.66 PPP dollars per person per day. The cost
was higher in Latin America and the Caribbean
(4.08 PPP dollars) compared to Asia (3.90 PPP dollars),
Africa (3.57 PPP dollars), Northern America and Europe
(3.22 PPP dollars), and Oceania (3.20 PPP dollars).
è In Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the
Caribbean, the cost of a healthy diet increased by
more than 5 percent from 2020 to 2021, negatively
affecting all subregions except for Northern Africa,
where the cost fell by 2.8 percent. In the same period,
the cost of a healthy diet rose in Oceania (5.2 percent)
and in Northern America and Europe (marginally,
by 0.6 percent). The surge hit lower-middle-income
countries more than high-income countries.
è More than 3.1 billion people in the world –
or 42 percent – were unable to afford a healthy diet in
2021, representing an increase of 134 million people
compared to 2019, before the pandemic. This reflects
the increase in the cost of a healthy diet that, in many
countries, occurred in combination with a decline in
disposable income.

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
è While Asia had the largest number of people who
were unable to afford a healthy diet (1.9 billion) in
2021, Africa reported the highest proportion of the
population unable to afford it (78 percent) compared
to Asia (44 percent), Latin America and the Caribbean
(23 percent), Oceania (3 percent), and Northern
America and Europe (1 percent).
è Southern Asia shows the highest number (1.4 billion)
and proportion (72 percent) of the population unable to
afford a healthy diet in Asia, with the prevalence almost
twice the regional average. Eastern and Western Africa
report the highest proportion (85 percent) in the Africa
region, as well as the highest number (712 million),
when considered together.
Healthy diets are essential for achieving food
security goals and improving nutritional
outcomes. A healthy diet is composed of a variety
of nutritious and safe foods that provide dietary
energy and nutrients in the amounts needed for
a healthy and active life. A healthy diet is based
on a wide range of unprocessed or minimally
processed foods, balanced across food groups,
while it restricts the consumption of highly
processed foods and drink products; it includes
wholegrains, legumes, nuts, an abundance and
variety of fruits and vegetables, and can include
moderate amounts of eggs, dairy, poultry and
fish, and small amounts of red meat.22, 23 Eating a
healthy diet throughout the life cycle is critical for
preventing all forms of malnutrition, including
child stunting and wasting, micronutrient
deficiencies and overweight or obesity. It also
helps reduce the risk of non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases,
diabetes and certain types of cancer.24
FAO, with support from the World Bank Data
Group, systematically monitors the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet (CoAHD) indicators
and recently began to disseminate the updated
series on the FAOSTAT database.25 These
indicators provide evidence regarding people’s
economic access to the lowest-cost healthy diet
in a given country, using locally available foods
to meet nutritional requirements. In this year’s
report, the CoAHD indicators are updated to
2021. Lack of updated income distribution at the
country level and of detailed food prices and
purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion factors
makes it impossible to update these estimates for
2022. See Annex 2, Section D for details on the
methodology and important updates.
This year, affordability indicators reflect not
only price shocks but also income shocks
induced by the pandemic, better capturing
the global situation in 2020 and 2021. This was
possible because income distributions – derived
from the Poverty and Inequality Platform to
estimate affordability – have now been updated
to include the years 2020 and 2021 for all
countries (see Annex 2, Section D).i
 Following
the recent release of new PPPs for 2017, the
World Bank adopted the latest conversion
factors to present its monetary indicators in 2017
PPP terms, including income distributions.26
Consequently, the indicators of affordability are
expressed in 2017 PPP rather than 2011 PPP, as in
previous years (see Annex 2, Section D).
The cost and affordability of a healthy
diet in 2021
The revised analysis presented in this year’s
report – which accounts for updated income
distributions in 2020 and 2021 – shows that
almost 3.2 billion people worldwide could
not afford a healthy diet in 2020, with a slight
improvement in 2021 (a decrease of 52 million
people). Food prices continued to climb
throughout 2021, pushing up the average cost of
a healthy diet globally. However, a rebound in
economic growth in many countries, particularly
in Asia, may have translated into larger fiscal
space for stimulus packages, social transfers
and improved labour markets.27, 28 These efforts
helped to counter the effects of high food
inflation, thereby reducing the number of people
unable to afford a healthy diet at the global level,
largely driven by Asia.
Table 5 presents the CoAHD indicators at the
global and regional levels, and by country
income group, for 2019, 2020 and 2021. Estimated
ranges of affordability indicators are presented
in Table A3.2 for 2021, where lower and upper
bounds reflect different assumptions about the
share of income reserved for food. Country-level
i In last year’s report, affordability in 2020 was obtained by applying
the cost of a healthy diet in 2020 to income distributions in 2019, hence
accounting for price shocks induced by the pandemic, but not for
income shocks.

NOTES: The cost of a healthy diet is expressed in purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars per person per day. The share of people unable to afford a
healthy diet is a weighted average (%) estimated using population data. The 2022 World Bank’s income classification is used to identify country
income groups. The calculation of the annual change (%) in the cost of a healthy diet is based on the cost rounded to three decimal places.

| 27 |
CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
estimates for the entire 2017–2021 series can be
found in Table A3.1.
In 2021, the average cost of a healthy diet globally
was 3.66 PPP dollars per person per day (Table 5).
The cost was higher in Latin America and the
Caribbean (4.08 PPP dollars) compared to Asia
(3.90 PPP dollars), Africa (3.57 PPP dollars),
Northern America and Europe (3.22 PPP dollars),
and Oceania (3.20 PPP dollars).
The cost of a healthy diet has been on the rise
since 2019. It increased globally by 6.7 percent
between 2019 and 2021, with a notable single-year
increase of 4.3 percent in 2021 (Table 5 and
Figure 10A). The surge in the cost of a healthy diet
reflects an overall rise in food inflation that
hit every region following the outbreak of the
pandemic. Soaring prices were mostly driven
by lockdowns and by disruptions in the global
supply chain and transportation systems, as
well as labour shortages hitting especially the
agriculture sector.8
The cost of a healthy diet increased by more than
5 percent between 2020 and 2021 in Africa, Asia,
Latin America and the Caribbean, and Oceania,
but only marginally in Northern America and
Europe (0.6 percent). The increase in cost in
Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and
Oceania was nearly double that which occurred
between 2019 and 2020, while the cost rose to a
lesser extent in Asia and in Northern America and
Europe (Table 5 and Figure 10A).
Between 2020 and 2021, soaring costs affected all
subregions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America
and the Caribbean, except for Northern Africa,
where the cost declined by 2.8 percent. The
cost of a healthy diet climbed by 7.6 percent in
Western Africa, a threefold increase compared
to the period between 2019 and 2020 (Table 5).
Eastern Africa also experienced a 6.7 percent
rise in the cost of a healthy diet, followed
by Southern Africa (5.8 percent) and Middle
Africa (5.3 percent). In Asia, the highest surge
was seen in Central Asia and Southern Asia
(7.2 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively).
Eastern Asia reported the smallest increase in
the cost between 2020 and 2021 (4.1 percent) and
showed a slowdown in cost inflation compared
to the previous period. In Latin America and
the Caribbean, the cost increase ranged from
6.4 percent in South America to 4.1 percent in
Central America.
The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated existing
inequalities across all regions in the world. Lowand middle-income countries have faced greater
challenges related to increases in food prices
and food insecurity compared to high-income
countries.29 This is also reflected in the increased
cost of a healthy diet from 2020 to 2021, which
was much larger in LMICs (6.2 percent increase),
UMICs (5.1 percent) and LICs (4.7 percent),
compared to HICs (2.1 percent) (Table 5).
About 3.14 billion people in the world – or
42 percent – were unable to afford a healthy
diet in 2021; this figure is down somewhat from
3.19 billion people – or 43 percent – in 2020 (Table 5
and Figure 10B). In many countries, the increase in
the cost of a healthy diet occurred in combination
with a decline in disposable income following the
persisting effects of the pandemic. Lockdowns,
economic downturns, and other pandemic-related
disruptions in 2020 led to job losses and reduced
incomes for many people, affecting low-income
households the most as they spend a higher share
of income on food.30 The impact of escalating
prices, coupled with a reduction in disposable
income in many countries, resulted in an
additional 186 million people unable to afford a
healthy diet in 2020 compared to 2019.
A slight turnaround occurred in 2021, when the
number of people unable to afford a healthy diet
declined by 52 million compared to 2020 (Table 5
and Figure 10B), but this is still 134 million more
people compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
A rebound in global GDP growth to 6 percent
in 2021, following the pandemic that plunged
most countries into recession in 2020,3 likely
alleviated the burden of unaffordability, owing
to several factors, including government stimulus
programmes, social protection measures, and
employment recovery, in some instances.31
However, the unequal pattern of economic
recovery across and within countries, coupled
with increasing prices and inequalities, has made
a healthy diet less affordable especially in some
regions, placing an additional burden on the
most vulnerable households.

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
Compared to 2019, the number of people unable
to afford a healthy diet was higher in 2021 in all
regions except Northern America and Europe,
where the number of people unable to afford the
diet decreased by 2.3 million despite the price
and income shocks induced by the pandemic
(Figure 10B). In Asia, the number of people who
could not afford a healthy diet increased by
154 million from 2019 to 2020, but then decreased
by 81.5 million from 2020 to 2021 (Figure 10B).
A notable improvement occurred from 2020 to
2021 in Eastern Asia, where a healthy diet was
out of reach for fewer people (71.5 million fewer
people could not afford it), and in Southern
Asia (17.4 million fewer people), following sharp
increases the previous year in the number
of people unable to afford this diet. Eastern
Asia is the only subregion in Asia reporting
an overall improvement in 2021 compared to
2019, as the number of people unable to afford a
healthy diet decreased by 18.4 million. In Africa,
unaffordability continued to worsen: 51.1 million
more people could not afford a healthy diet
in 2021 compared to 2019, with the highest
increase occurring from 2019 to 2020 (31 million).
Sub-Saharan Africa reported the largest increase
in the number of people unable to afford a
healthy diet from 2019 to 2021 (54 million
more people), while the situation improved in
Northern Africa, where the diet was out of reach

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
for almost 3 million fewer people (Table 5). Finally,
in Latin America and the Caribbean, 13.4 million
more people could not afford a healthy diet
in 2021 compared to 2019, with the largest
increase in South America (13.3 million people)
due to a sharp jump from 2020 to 2021 (Table 5
and Figure 10B).
Of the people in the world who were unable
to afford a healthy diet in 2021, 1.9 billion, or
62 percent, were found in Asia (Figure 11). In terms
of proportion, however, Africa was the region
with the highest proportion of the population
that could not afford a healthy diet in 2021
(78 percent) compared to Asia (44 percent), Latin
America and the Caribbean (23 percent), Oceania
(3 percent), and Northern America and Europe
(1 percent) (Table 5).
Almost 70 percent of the people in Africa who
were unable to afford a healthy diet lived in
Eastern and Western Africa. Considered together,
the two subregions reported the highest number
(712 million) and proportion (85 percent) of
people who were unable to afford a healthy diet
in Africa in 2021 (Table 5 and Figure 11). A high
proportion was also found in Middle Africa
(82 percent) in 2021, followed by Southern Africa
(67 percent) and Northern Africa (52 percent),
whose percentage was lower than the regional
average (78 percent).
In Asia, Southern Asia showed the highest
number (1.4 billion) and proportion (72 percent)
of people unable to afford a healthy diet in 2021,
far above the regional average of 44 percent.
In South-eastern Asia, around 55 percent of
people could not afford this diet, and the number
has been increasing since 2019.
Finally, in Latin America and the Caribbean,
63 percent of the people unable to afford a healthy
diet lived in South America, and only 12 percent
lived in the Caribbean (Figure 11). The Caribbean
was the subregion with the lowest absolute
number of people (15 million) but the highest
proportion of the population (57 percent) unable
to afford a healthy diet – more than twice the
regional average.
The indicators described in this section and in
Annex 2 and Annex 3 provide a snapshot of the
“average” cost and affordability situation at the
global, regional and country levels. However,
they do not fully capture the heterogeneous
characteristics of a population that determine the
ability to afford a healthy diet within a country
or a region. Affordability is affected not only by
the average cost of a healthy diet and people’s
incomes, but also by factors such as place of
residence, proximity to food markets, or food
production for own consumption. Due to data
limitations, affordability estimates cannot control
for these factors and may overestimate, in some
instances, the cost of a healthy diet for specific
population subgroups, and hence the number
of people whose income falls below the cost
threshold for a healthy diet. n

TARGETS
 KEY MESSAGES
è Worldwide in 2022 among children under five years
of age, an estimated 148.1 million (22.3 percent) were
stunted, 45 million (6.8 percent) were wasted and
37 million (5.6 percent) were overweight.
è Global stunting prevalence was 1.6 times higher
and wasting prevalence 1.4 times higher in rural versus
urban areas. The prevalence of overweight was only
slightly higher in urban children (5.4 percent) compared
to rural children (3.5 percent).
è There has been steady progress in reducing stunting
since 2012, but the world is still not on track to achieve
the 2030 target of 13.5 percent (50 percent reduction in
the number of children with stunting from the baseline).
In the ten years since 2012, the number of children with
stunting declined by nearly 30 million.
è Reduction in wasting is making some progress
but global prevalence is more than twice the 2030
target. Wasting among children was highest in lowand lower-middle-income countries (94 percent of the
global burden).
| 31 |
CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
è Globally, the majority of overweight children
(77 percent) lived in lower-middle- and
upper-middle-income countries in 2022. In terms of
progress towards the 2030 target of less than 3 percent
prevalence, no regions were on track and only Northern
America and Europe made some progress towards
the target.
è Globally, there has been no significant change in
low birthweight over the last two decades – 16.6 percent
in 2000 compared with 14.7 percent in 2020 –
and no region is on track to attain the 2030 target
of a 30 percent reduction since the 2012 baseline.
Data gaps present a challenge to the global monitoring
of low birthweight, as nearly one in three newborns in
the world were not weighed at birth in 2020.
è Steady progress has been made on exclusive
breastfeeding, with 47.7 percent of infants under six
months of age exclusively breastfed worldwide in
2021, up from 37.0 percent in 2012. An estimated
75 percent of exclusively breastfed infants live in lowor lower-middle-income countries.
è Conflict, climate change and rising food prices,
along with the persisting effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, all threaten progress towards achieving the
2030 global nutrition targets. Coordinated efforts are
needed to eliminate malnutrition in all its forms.
The importance of nutrition and reporting
on the Sustainable Development Goals
Nutrition is mentioned specifically in SDG 2 but
it is central to the achievement of all 17 SDGs,
specifically those related to health, education,
gender equality and the climate.32 This section
presents an assessment of global and regional
levels and trends for global nutrition targets.
There are updates on five of the six nutrition
targets initially endorsed by the World Health
Assembly (WHA) in 2012 to be achieved by
2025, for which extended 2030 targets were
subsequently proposed by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and the United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF). Four out of the six
indicators were also selected to monitor progress
towards SDG Target 2.2, namely stunting, wasting
and overweight in children under five years of
age, and anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years.
A seventh target to halt the rise in adult obesity
was adopted by the WHA as part of the Global
Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of
NCDs in 2013. Only the indicators for stunting,
wasting, overweight, exclusive breastfeeding and
low birthweight will be presented in this edition
of the report, as updated data were not available
for anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years
and adult obesity.
Global trends and burden of malnutrition
Conflict, climate change and the enduring
secondary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
continue to affect malnutrition, birthweights and
caring practices like exclusive breastfeeding.
The 2022 edition of this report presented multiple
pathways for the pandemic to impact child
nutrition along with potential risks stemming
from the war in Ukraine. Although the effects
of the current crises on malnutrition are not yet
fully reflected in the updates presented in this
edition of the report, due either to data sparsity or
to the long-term impact of some of the nutritional
outcomes, negative impacts on various forms
of malnutrition are expected at the global level.
Any potential global consequences of the war
in Ukraine on malnutrition are also yet to be
measured comprehensively. The global trends
in prevalence and absolute numbers for five
nutrition indicators are summarized in Figure 12.
The latest estimate for low birthweight reveals
that 14.7 percent of newborns (19.8 million) were
born with low birthweight (less than 2 500 g) in
2020, a non-significant decline from 16.6 percent
(22.1 million) in 2000. Infants born weighing
less than 2 500 g are approximately 20 times
more likely to die than those with adequate
birthweight,33 and those who survive face
long-term development and health consequences,
including a higher risk of stunting, a diminished
intelligence quotient, and increased risk of
obesity and diabetes as adults.34
Optimal breastfeeding practices, including
exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months
of life, are critical for child survival and the
promotion of health and cognitive development.35
Globally, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding
among infants under six months of age rose from
37.0 percent (24.3 million) in 2012 to 47.7 percent
(31.2 million) in 2021. Worldwide, over half of all

infants under six months of age do not receive the
protective benefits of exclusive breastfeeding.
Stunting, the condition of being too short for
one’s age, is a marker for longer-term chronic
malnutrition. It is caused by a combination of
nutritional and other factors that simultaneously
undermine the physical and cognitive
development of children and increase their risk
of dying from common infections. Stunting and
other forms of undernutrition early in life may
also predispose children to overweight and
NCDs later in life.36 Globally, the prevalence of
stunting among children under five years of

NOTES: Wasting is an acute condition that can change frequently and rapidly over the course of a calendar year. The UNICEF-WHO-World Bank: Joint
child malnutrition estimates do not currently adjust for seasonal variation that can affect wasting prevalence estimates. The global estimates of the
number of children with wasting are based on national-level prevalence data which capture the cases of wasting at a given moment in time. As such,
the reported estimates do not reflect the cumulative cases of wasting over the year.

age has declined steadily, from an estimated
33.0 percent (204.2 million) in 2000 to 22.3 percent
(148.1 million) in 2022.
Child wasting is a life-threatening condition
caused by insufficient nutrient intake, poor
nutrient absorption and/or frequent or prolonged
illness. Affected children are dangerously
thin, with weakened immunity and a higher
risk of mortality.37 The prevalence of wasting
among children under five years of age declined
non-significantly from 8.7 percent in 2000 to
6.8 percent in 2022. The estimated number of
children with wasting declined from 54.1 million
in 2000 to 45.0 million in 2022, but it is important
to note that these are point estimates and not
representative of the cumulative number of
cases of wasting over the year. The global
prevalence-based estimates of children under
five years of age affected by wasting from the
UNICEF-WHO-World Bank: Joint child malnutrition
estimates should be considered underestimates
of the annual burden. Wasting is an acute
condition that can change rapidly and is affected
by seasonal changes in many contexts.38, 39
This makes reliable national trends over time
challenging to estimate and interpret.
Children who are overweight or obese face
both immediate and potentially long-term
health impacts. Immediate impacts include
respiratory difficulties, increased risk of fractures,
hypertension, early markers of cardiovascular
disease, insulin resistance and psychological
effects.40 Affected individuals also have a higher
risk of NCDs later in life. Child overweight has
been on the rise in many countries, hastened
by increasingly inadequate levels of physical
activity and increased access to highly processed
foods, which tend to be high in energy, fats, free
sugars and/or salt.23 Globally, the prevalence
of overweight among children under five years
of age showed a non-significant increase from
5.3 percent (33.0 million) in 2000 to 5.6 percent
(37.0 million) in 2022. The personal, community
and societal costs of overweight and obesity are
heavy and are increasing globally.41
Nutrition across country income groups
The global burden of malnutrition varies
substantially across country income groups
and over time. These analyses examine the
distribution of the burden based on the latest
classification of a country’s income group.
The distributions of the global burden for five
nutrition indicators by country income group
are presented in Figure 13. For each indicator,
the distributions in 2012 and in the year for which
the most recent data are available are presented to
show changes over time.
LICs and LMICs together carried the brunt of the
low birthweight burden among newborns in both
2012 and 2020 – a total of 84 percent of the global
burden of low birthweight in 2020 – while the two
country income groups together represented only
70 percent of global annual births. Overall, the
distribution of the burden across income groups
remained similar between 2012 and 2020. The
proportion of low birthweight in LICs increased
from 15 percent to 18 percent, in parallel with the
fastest global population growth.
Worldwide, the largest proportion of exclusively
breastfed infants live in LICs or LMICs, and the
combined estimate did not change from 2012
to 2021 (75 percent). The greatest proportion of
exclusively breastfed children is found in LMICs
(55 percent), while these countries represent
only 52 percent of the overall target population.
For HICs, there were insufficient data to examine
the portion of exclusively breastfed infants;
thus, the proportional contribution of HICs to
the global total is presented as “estimates not
available” in Figure 13.
The proportion of stunting in children under five
years of age increased in LICs from 21 percent in
2012 to 26 percent in 2022, while the proportion of
children under five years of age in these countries
increased from 14 percent to 17 percent. For LICs
and LMICs combined, the proportion of stunted
children increased from 88 percent in 2012 to
90 percent in 2022, while these country income
groups only represented 64 percent of all children
under five years of age globally in 2012 and
68 percent in 2022.
As they do for low birthweight and stunting,
LICs and LMICs also bear the greatest burden
of wasting. These groups comprised a combined
total of 92 percent in 2012 and 94 percent in 2022
of all wasted children under five years of age,
| 34 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
despite representing only 68 percent of the global
population under five years of age in 2022.
The proportion of overweight children in LICs
and LMICs combined increased from 49 percent
in 2012 to 53 percent in 2022. While these changes
were marginal, they illustrate the rising threats
of overweight and obesity among populations of
lower country income groups. The distribution
across country income groups of the burden of
overweight among children under five years of
age changed marginally between 2012 and 2022,
with a small increase in the number of overweight
children residing in LMICs and a small decline
in numbers of overweight children in UMICs.
The majority of overweight children (77 percent)
live in LMICs and UMICs.

exclusive breastfeeding; this varies from the global totals (depicted below each year), which are aligned with global estimates used elsewhere in this

100 percent due to rounding. ** Due to space limitations, the population distribution for infants under six months of age in 2012 and 2021 is not shown,
but the distributions are the same as for annual births in 2020 and only vary from 2012 births in high-income countries for which the proportion for
infants under six months of age was 10 percent in 2012. *** Exclusive breastfeeding estimates are not available for high-income countries, so their

CHAPTER 2 FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION AROUND THE WORLD
The analysis presented indicates that LICs and
LMICs are home to the majority of infants who
benefit from exclusive breastfeeding. It also
highlights that LICs and LMICs combined carry
the greatest burden for low birthweight, stunting,
wasting and overweight.
Progress towards ending all forms of
malnutrition by 2030
Global progress
Global progress towards the five nutrition
2030 targets for which indicators have been
updated is summarized in Figure 14. The 2020 low
birthweight prevalence of 14.7 percent has not
declined quickly enough to be on track for the
2030 target of a 30 percent reduction from the
2012 baseline. The available low birthweight
data suffer from data quality issues, especially
among countries that are most likely to have
high prevalence, and nearly one in three
newborns in the world were not weighed at
birth in 2020. Improvements in low birthweight
data quality and representativeness are needed
to assess the severity and magnitude of the
problem more reliably.
The proportion of exclusively breastfed infants
under six months of age increased from
37.0 percent in 2012 to 47.7 percent in 2021.
Although this is close to the 50 percent target
for 2025, the world is not on track to achieve
the 2030 target of at least 70 percent. To achieve
this target, sustained investment is needed in
effective interventions that promote the adoption
and continuation of exclusive breastfeeding (such
as adequate paid maternity leave and workplace
policies to ensure nearby access to quality
childcare, breastfeeding breaks and dedicated
nursing spaces), along with greater protection
and support for breastfeeding in emergency
contexts. Enactment and enforcement of the
International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk
Substitutes,42 institutionalization of the
Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative,43 and scaling
up of antenatal and postnatal breastfeeding
counselling will also help countries to reach their
individual targets.
Stunting in children under five years of
age decreased from 26.3 percent in 2012 to
22.3 percent in 2022. To be on track for the
target of a 13.5 percent stunting prevalence
in 2030, however, the prevalence needed to
reach 18.2 percent in 2022. Strong progress
has been made, but larger investments in
nutrition-appropriate policies and actions across
multiple systems will be required to ensure
greater strides are made in reducing stunting.
The global prevalence of wasting among
children under five years of age did not change
significantly from 2012 to 2022, declining from
7.5 percent to 6.8 percent. The 2022 estimate is
more than double the 2030 target of less than
3 percent. These results signal that greater
targeting of resources is needed towards those
countries with the highest burden to increase
their access to essential actions for the prevention
of child wasting across multiple systems,
including health, water and sanitation, education,
and social policy. To ensure achievement of the
global targets, scaling up of early detection,
optimized treatments, and monitoring and
delivery of effective services for reducing child
wasting are needed, as per the Global Action
Plan on Child Wasting.44
To achieve the 2030 target of 3 percent for child
overweight, a shift is required in the direction of
the global trend. The prevalence of overweight
remained stagnant at 5.5 percent in 2012 and
5.6 percent in 2022. To address overweight and
obesity in the youngest age groups, it is critical
to invest in effective promotion and adoption of
positive habits including healthy feeding patterns,
avoiding easy access to foods high in sugars,
salt and fats, as well as active play and other
types of physical activity.45
Regional progress
This section presents an assessment of the
progress towards the 2030 global nutrition targets
at the regional and subregional levels. The
regional and subregional analysis is based on
the annual average rate of reduction46 observed
from trends between the baseline and the most
recent year of the indicator, compared to the rate
of reduction needed between 2012 and 2030 to
reach the global targets. Progress is calculated
as the progress achieved versus the change
required to bring the indicators to the desired
levels (Table 6). (The methodology is described in
Annex 2, Section F.)
| 36 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
For low birthweight, no region is on track to reach
the 2030 targets and global progress is off track
(no progress or worsening). Only Africa made
modest progress (off track – some progress) and
the remaining regions have made no progress
(off track – no progress or worsening) towards
the 30 percent reduction in prevalence of low
birthweight. Despite Africa being one of the
two regions with the highest prevalence of low
birthweight, it is the region where some progress
is being achieved in three out of five subregions.
At the global level, there has been some progress
(off track – some progress) towards reaching
the 2030 target for exclusive breastfeeding.
At the regional level, Africa, Asia, and Latin
America and the Caribbean have all achieved
some progress (off track – some progress).

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Considerable improvements have been made
in Eastern Africa and Southern Asia with
exclusive breastfeeding, both of which are on
track to reach their targets. Subregions that
are not progressing (off track – no progress or
worsening) include the Caribbean, Oceania
excluding Australia and New Zealand, Northern
America and Western Asia. The subregions
with inadequate data (assessment not possible)
include Australia and New Zealand, Europe,
Northern Africa and Southern Africa.
Global estimates show some progress (off track
– some progress) towards reaching the stunting
reduction target. Northern America and Europe
are on track. All other regions except Oceania
excluding Australia and New Zealand achieved
some progress (off track – some progress) on
stunting reduction. The subregions considered
on track for stunting include Australia and New
Zealand, Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Europe and
Northern America. The remaining subregions
are making some progress on stunting with the
exception of Middle Africa and Southern Africa.
For wasting at the global level, some progress
(off track – some progress) has been achieved,
with Latin America and the Caribbean on track
to reach the 2030 target. Among the subregions,
those on track are the Caribbean, Central
America, Central Asia, Eastern Asia, Northern
America and South America. Africa and Asia have
made some progress (off track – some progress) to
address this dangerous condition in regions with
the highest prevalence.
There has been no progress in reducing
overweight in children to meet the 2030 target
at the global level (off track – no progress).
The prevalence of overweight is worsening in
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America
and the Caribbean, and Oceania excluding
Australia and New Zealand. The situation is
comparatively better in Africa; the region is still
off track (no progress), but with a non-significant
reduction in overweight in children under
five years of age.
Great achievements have been made in promoting
exclusive breastfeeding and reducing stunting,
but the results vary across regions. Malnutrition
in all its forms is found across all regions and
could be underestimated due to various factors,
as mentioned at the beginning of this section.
Achieving the 2030 global nutrition targets
requires stronger and more concerted efforts
to prevent global setbacks. The global trends
in stunting, wasting, exclusive breastfeeding
and low birthweight must be accelerated,
while for overweight in children they will
have to be reversed, to achieve the 2030 global
nutrition targets.
Urban–rural differences in
nutrition indicators
In the past, urban children held a distinct
advantage of being better nourished than rural
children.47 The higher incomes and improved
food access and availability associated with urban
residence allowed children to obtain more regular
and diverse diets as well as access to health
services, potable water and sanitation. But with
continued urbanization and the rapid rise in
urban poor, there is now a larger population
dependent on the most easily available and
inexpensive foods which are often not nutritious
or hygienic, increasing the risk of malnutrition.
Rural populations often depend on agriculture for
their livelihoods. At the same time, the poorest
populations are typically found in agricultural
regions across and within countries. Hence, when
other labour opportunities arise, people often
move away from poorly compensated agricultural
work, which reinforces the paradox that in
agricultural regions, the population and notably
its children are more likely to be malnourished.48
In fact, it has been demonstrated that proximity
to agricultural food production does not translate
into healthier diets for children. The 2022 report
on child food poverty found a higher prevalence
of severe food poverty (consuming foods from
only two food groups or less per day) among
children living in rural areas.49
Urban–rural differences in stunting and
wasting arise in part from disparities in access
to health care, water, sanitation and a hygienic
environment.50 Implementation of key public
health interventions across the continuum of
care helps to improve the health and nutritional
status of children and mothers, through provision
of care at first-line health facilities. Improved

sanitation and hygiene practices can make
significant differences in halting the cycle of
infectious disease and undernutrition.
Since 2000, as urban populations have undergone
the nutrition transition, nutrition-related NCDs –
including obesity, diabetes and hypertension –
have caused a larger proportion of death
and disability compared to undernutrition.51
Worldwide, rural populations are now
undergoing the same transition, and in some
areas are beginning to show higher prevalence of
overweight and obesity compared to urban areas.52
The unfinished agendas to reduce stunting,
wasting and micronutrient deficiency, along
with rising overweight and obesity, represent
the current challenge to address multiple forms
of malnutrition. Malnutrition in all its forms
is related to poor diets, the rise of low-cost
nutrient-poor foods and the increasing availability
of highly processed foods in rural areas.53, 54
Figure 15 presents the prevalence of four nutrition
indicators in rural and urban areas.
The definitions of rural and urban residence used
in the analysis are based on national definitions
recorded in national master sample frames
employed to generate survey samples.j
 The criteria
are commonly based on population size, range of
economic activities undertaken, whether the area
has been assigned an administrative function,
or a combination of these characteristics. For
more information on rural–urban classification,
see Box 3 in Chapter 3.
The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding is
significantly higher in rural Asia (58.6 percent)
than in urban Asia (50.2 percent). No significant
differences were found in exclusive breastfeeding
by area of residence in Africa, Latin America
and the Caribbean, and Oceania excluding
Australia and New Zealand. Globally,
exclusive breastfeeding is higher in rural areas
(53.9 percent) than in urban areas (45.3 percent)
with the differences bordering on statistical
significance but clearly indicating public health
significance for the millions of children who
benefit from exclusive breastfeeding.
j Therefore, the rural–urban classifications are not entirely comparable
across countries, as are the DEGURBA classifications used in Section 2.1
and the URCA classification used in Chapter 3 (see Box 3).
For stunting, there are major rural–urban
differences globally and in three of the five
regions. In Africa, Asia, and Latin America and
the Caribbean, the prevalence of stunting in rural
areas is 9 to 15 percentage points higher than in
urban areas. Globally, the prevalence of stunting
is higher in rural areas (35.8 percent) than in
urban areas (22.4 percent).
Wasting presented a similar distribution, with
the global prevalence significantly higher in
rural areas (10.5 percent) than in urban areas
(7.7 percent). In Asia, there is a significant
difference in wasting between rural (14.3 percent)
and urban (11.8 percent) areas. No rural–urban
differences were found in Africa or Latin America
and the Caribbean.
For child overweight, there are small but
significant differences by rural–urban residence
that serve as an important alert. In Asia and
globally, overweight prevalence was nearly
two percentage points higher in urban areas
(5.3 percent in Asia and 5.4 percent globally)
than in rural areas (3.5 percent in both). The
highest reported regional prevalence in 2022 was
among children residing in urban areas of Latin
America and the Caribbean (9.1 percent). Current
results were not available in the most urbanized
subregions, namely Australia and New Zealand,
Europe and Northern America.
The results from these analyses help to identify
vulnerable population groups, contributing to
evidence to inform decision-making and effective
action through the appropriate targeting and
design of policies and programmes. Sound
nutrition is fundamental to the achievement of
the Sustainable Development Goals and must be
central in government policy and supported by
key stakeholders, including civil society and the
private sector. n

CHAPTER 3
URBANIZATION IS
TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD
SYSTEMS AND AFFECTING
ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE
HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS THE
RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
 KEY MESSAGES
è Growing urbanization is a megatrend that, combined
with changes in incomes, employment and lifestyles,
is driving changes throughout agrifood systems across
the rural–urban continuum, from food production,
food processing, food distribution and procurement, to
consumer behaviour.
è These changes represent both challenges and
opportunities to ensure everyone has access to
affordable healthy diets. Challenges include the
increasing availability of cheap, energy-dense and
highly processed foods and the exclusion of small
farmers from formalizing value chains. But there are
also opportunities for increased employment along the
food value chains and improvements in the variety of
nutritious foods.
è The centrality of large cities to the transformation
of agrifood systems is challenged by the fact that, due
to urbanization, nowadays one-fourth of the global
population live in peri-urban areas of intermediate and
small cities and towns, which can serve as important
nodes in strengthening rural–urban linkages and the
functioning of value chains.
è Moreover, with the convergence of high food
purchases in both peri-urban and rural areas, where
almost half of the global population live, markets
in these areas are a significant driver of agrifood
systems transformation.
è Urbanization is often associated with a
diversification of diets, including increased consumption
of dairy, fish, meat, vegetables, fruits and legumes –
foods that can contribute to a healthy diet.
è But there are challenges: i) the availability of
vegetables and fruits, in particular, is insufficient
to meet the daily requirements of a healthy diet in
almost every region of the world; and ii) urbanization
contributes to the spread of convenience, pre-prepared
and fast foods, often energy dense and high in fats,
sugars and/or salt, which are increasingly abundant and
also cheaper.
è The increased demand for high-value crops, such as
fruits and vegetables and processed products, including
in rural areas, has led to significant growth in longer,
more formal and complex food value chains, providing
greater income opportunities for off-farm employment,
especially for women and youth.
è Supply-side factors, including globalized technology
in food production, transportation and marketing,
coupled with an increase in demand for readily available
foods, have contributed to a substantial expansion
of supermarkets, hypermarkets, food deliveries and
other convenience retailers. However, these are
also associated with increased supply and spread of
energy-dense and highly processed foods.

CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
Figure 16. This process is fast-changing, context
specific and driven by intertwined factors,
including diverse economic developments
(e.g. increasing agricultural productivity),
policy choices, availability of natural resources,
and external stressors such as conflict, climate
extremes or environmental degradation.
Many parts of the world have rapidly urbanized
since the Second World War, with the urban share
of the world’s population rising from 30 percent in
1950 to 57 percent in 2021. It is projected to reach
68 percent by 2050.1 In most regions, this has
been largely driven by structural transformation,
which entails an economic transformation from
mainly agriculture to a more diversified national
economy, in the process attracting rural people
to urban areas.2
The structural transformation of economies is
characterized by improvements in productivity,
especially of labour, and changes in the relative
importance of sectors through the reallocation
of production factors such as labour and capital.3
This entails four interrelated processes: i) a
declining share of agriculture in gross domestic
product (GDP) and employment, and a gradual
shift of jobs from the primary agriculture sector
to secondary and tertiary sector jobs, typically
located in urban areas; ii) rural-to-urban
migration; iii) the rise of a modern industrial and
service economy; and iv) a demographic transition
from high to low rates of births and deaths.2, 4, 5, 6
As the relationship between agriculture and the
rest of the economy changes, rural transformation
occurs. The latter refers to the process of
inclusive and sustainable improvements in rural
livelihoods following rising productivity of
(smallholder) agriculture, increasing marketable
surpluses, rising off-farm employment
opportunities in rural areas, better access to
services and infrastructure also in rural areas,
and the capacity to influence policy, embedded
in national processes of economic growth and
structural transformation.7 This process involves
a strengthening of rural–urban linkages, which
connect agriculture and other activities in the
rural economy to the manufacturing and service
sectors as they expand into urban centres.3
Growth in non-farm sectors and shifts in the
labour force out of farming are then expected to
è As urban areas and rural areas become more
interlinked, rural producers often have better access
to agricultural inputs and services, allowing for
improved productivity, which typically increases income
levels. However, there are also risks that small-scale
producers in peri-urban areas may lose their lands to
urban expansion.
è Overall, access to affordable healthy diets and
food security are better in cities than in rural areas,
although this generalization is complicated by the
socioeconomic disparities in diet affordability and food
security that exist within urban areas and across the
rural–urban continuum.
Urbanization, combined with other contextual
factors such as rising incomes, employment and
changing lifestyles, is driving changes throughout
agrifood systems across the rural–urban
continuum, including food production, food
processing, food distribution and procurement,
and consumer behaviour. These changes may
also lead to disparities across this continuum,
with both positive and negative effects on the
availability and affordability of healthy diets, and
in turn, on food security and nutrition outcomes.
This chapter first examines the drivers, patterns
and dynamics of urbanization, through a
rural–urban continuum lens. It then presents
a conceptual framework to understand the
pathways through which urbanization is
affecting agrifood systems across the rural–urban
continuum. Last, the chapter summarizes the
challenges and opportunities that urbanization
and the associated agrifood systems changes can
pose for access to affordable healthy diets. n
3.1
DRIVERS, PATTERNS
AND DYNAMICS OF
URBANIZATION
Drivers of urbanization
Urbanization is the result of urban population
growth, urban expansion (i.e. reclassification of
rural areas to peri-urban or urban) and migration
from rural to urban areas, as conceptualized in
| 44 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
gradually contribute to land consolidation and
rising farm sizes. Improvements in agricultural
productivity are a necessary condition for such
a process to result in reductions in rural poverty
and overall improvements in living standards.
However, the theory that urbanization goes hand
in hand with economic growth and structural
transformation does not hold for all countries
and regions. Although countries with a high
share of urban population are often more
prosperous than countries with a large rural
population, this is not true in all cases.8 Figure 17
shows that although a trend can be seen between
GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP)
and level of urbanization (measured by the share
of the urban population), there is no one-to-one
association. For example, in 2019, 91 percent of
Jordan’s population was urban, but this country’s
GDP per capita was relatively low at almost
10 000 PPP dollars per year. Likewise, in Gabon,
90 percent of the population was living in cities
in 2019, but the country’s GDP per capita was
around 15 000 PPP dollars per year. Small island
countries and territories (Antigua and Barbuda,
Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Aruba), as well as
small landlocked countries, have lower levels
of urbanization than expected considering their
relatively high GDP per capita.
Urbanization without structural transformation
and economic growth occurred in some of the
poorest countries in the late twentieth century.9
As in the cases above, the increase in share of
population in cities does not necessarily indicate
high economic growth. Rather urbanization is
associated with other “atypical” developments.
First, overall population growth leads to
growth in both urban and rural areas. Without
increases in agricultural productivity, rural
population growth results in land subdivision,
unviable farming plots and a lack of livelihood
opportunities in rural areas. Rural inhabitants
then migrate to cities where opportunities may
be limited (because of the lack of economic
growth), resulting in increases in urban poverty.
Second, urban population growth stretches the
capacity of urban infrastructure and social and
other services to the limit. This is particularly
the case for rapidly growing urban areas,
where investments have not kept pace with
urban expansion.

CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
Urbanization without economic growth can
be linked to poor rural living conditions –
including poverty, lack of employment or
underemployment, lack of infrastructure, lack of
access to services and food insecurity – and/or
environmental degradation.10, 11, 12 Southern
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are two regions
where structural transformation is lagging
behind, as a result of the low productivity of
subsistence agriculture and, above all, the rapid
rates of population growth and urbanization.3
In sub-Saharan Africa, there is less poverty
reduction alongside urbanization than is
historically observed in other regions.13 Through
the late 1990s, sub-Saharan Africa had the highest
rate of urbanization in the world; however, this
took place in the midst of lagging performances
in agriculture and the broader economy.k
In the late 1990s, per capita income growth in
this subregion began to increase significantly,
outpacing many countries around the world; still
however, aspects of the economic transformation
show significant divergences from urbanization
driven by structural transformation elsewhere.15
For example, rural populations continue to
grow as most African countries are urbanizing
and farm labour is not necessarily moving to
k In sub-Saharan Africa, the urban population share rose by a factor of
3.2, from 11 percent in 1950 to 36 percent in 2010. In comparison,
Asia’s urban population share during this period increased only
2.5 times (from 18 percent to 44 percent), and Latin America’s
1.9 times (from 41 percent to 79 percent).14

off-farm sectors of the economy.15 Moreover,
urban-based households, many of whom are
medium-scale investor farmers, control a sizeable
share of national agricultural land and continue
to invest there.
Another factor that may contribute to
urbanization is climate change and environmental
degradation, which can affect rural-to-urban
migration movements.16, 17 Generally, in
low-income rural regions, the lower the per capita
income, the larger the share of the labour force
employed in agriculture, forestry and fisheries.18
This means that more people in these regions
depend on natural resources for their livelihoods,
and are therefore more vulnerable to climate
change and environmental degradation.19 If
the agriculture, forestry, fisheries and land-use
sectors are weakened from the effects of climate
change and biodiversity loss, these populations
may be compelled to migrate to urban areas in
search of work.20 With the growing magnitude
of climate change impacts, future rural-to-urban
migration may be increasingly affected.
However, migration may be neither possible
nor desirable for all affected populations. Some
of the poorest and most vulnerable groups
(including women, children and the elderly) can
become trapped in rural areas, their mobility
constrained by insufficient resources or social
norms. Evidence also indicates that others may
choose to remain in high-risk areas due to a
strong attachment to their ancestral land and
livelihoods.21 While migration to cities presents
risks and opportunities, those who remain in
rural areas, whether willingly or unwillingly, are
disproportionately vulnerable to climate change
impacts, which will have adverse implications for
their future livelihoods and food security.
Where there are recurrent climate shocks,
patterns of movement can become cyclical,
pre-emptive and permanent because of perceived
future risk. For example, evidence from
Bangladesh suggests that around 22 percent of
rural households affected by tidal-surge floods,
and 16 percent of those affected by riverbank
erosion, have migrated to urban areas.22 Evidence
from sub-Saharan Africa shows that, between
1960 and 2000, nearly 50 percent of net migrationl
(estimated at 5 million people) was due to changes
in temperature and rainfall, which affected
agricultural production and brought about a
reduction in farm incomes and rural wages, thus
spurring rural-to-urban movements.23
Sending one or more family members into cities to
work in sectors other than agriculture, especially
for poor rural households, is often important in
order to reduce the risks of hunger and extreme
poverty, and to cope with possible adverse
shocks the household might face. For example,
evidence from the Sidama District in southern
Ethiopia shows that households whose members
were anxious about a decrease in quality and
quantity of food were more likely to decide that
an adult should migrate in search of employment
to support better lives for themselves and the
family.24 Additional evidence from the same
country confirmed these results: for households
without a migrant member, the inability to feed
the family compared to neighbouring households
with migrant members increased by four times
the propensity to send out a migrant for work.25
There is also an increasing occurrence of
forced displacement from rural areas to urban
areas, often as a result of disasters and/or
conflict. Displaced populations are increasingly
concentrating in cities, with 61 percent of the
26 million refugees,26 and two out of three
internally displaced persons, residing in urban
areas in 2019.27
Patterns and dynamics of urbanization
With urban expansion and improving road and
communication infrastructure across ever larger
parts of rural areas, the distinction between rural
and urban areas is increasingly blurred. A large
share of the new urban dwellers are expected
to live in peri-urban areas, as well as in small
cities and interconnected towns. Increasingly,
rural and urban areas are less separate spaces
in their own right, but rather two ends of a
spectrum, connected via numerous linkages
across a rural–urban continuum (Box 2), which are
important for agrifood systems.

CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
 BOX 2 UNTANGLING THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
Global populations are regularly categorized as
living either in urban centres or in rural areas.
This distinction is often attributed to data limitations
but also to the practicality of the categorization,
for example in national ministries which are
usually divided by rural and urban mandates.28, 29
This approach also tends to focus on the rural–urban
divide, with the conclusion that rural areas typically
lag behind their urban counterparts.30, 31 However,
this divide is challenged both in science and in
policy, due to the increasing interconnectedness
between various types of population agglomerations.
There is no commonly agreed upon definition
of the term “urban” across countries, and thus
comparability of “urban areas” across countries
and regions is not always straightforward.32
This limitation carries over directly to globally
reported urban population statistics by the United
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs,
which classifies areas as urban according to the
criteria used by each country or territory.33 Criteria
may be based on political/administrative aspects,
structural and/or functional characteristics related
to population density and size or the functions that
cities have for their inhabitants.34
Recently, important advances were made in
developing a methodology for delineating urban and
rural areas for international and regional statistical
comparisons.35 The UN Statistical Commission
endorsed the Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA)
in March 2020 – a methodology developed by a
consortium of the European Union and international
agencies (Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development [OECD], World Bank, FAO,
United Nations Human Settlements Programme
[UN-Habitat] and International Labour Organization
[ILO]). This methodology classifies the entire territory
of a country across a rural–urban continuum,36
by degree of urbanization. The classification
system consists of three classes – cities, towns
and semi-dense areas, and rural areas – and seven
subclasses for the rural and semi-dense areas, based
on population size and density, using the same
thresholds across the globe, and thus ensuring global
comparability.37 The outcome is an open-access
geospatial dataset. This official classification system
is used for the first time in Chapter 2, to look at
differences in SDG Indicator 2.1.2 (prevalence
of moderate or severe food insecurity in the
population based on the Food Insecurity Experience
Scale [FIES]) among rural, peri-urban and urban
populations around the world.
To explore how urbanization shapes agrifood
systems, a more granular lens of the rural–urban
continuum is useful. For this reason another
publically available global geospatial dataset –
Urban Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) – is used
for the country case study analysis in Chapter 4.
This newly available global geospatial dataset
provides a global mapping of the rural–urban
continuum,28, 38 based on the Global Human
Settlement Layer.39 Like the DEGURBA classification,
it places urban centres on a gradient based on
population size and density, whereby city size is a
proxy for the breadth of services and opportunities
provided by an urban centre. But it also adds a
second dimension: rural locations are assigned a
gradient of their own, using the shortest travel time
to urban centres of various sizes as a proxy for the
cost of accessing goods, services and employment
opportunities (Figure A). Thus, the URCA dataset
disaggregates rural areas into multiple categories;
distinguishing, for example, between locations that
are less than 1 hour from an urban centre (in yellow)
and those that are farther away.
The URCA methodology for defining urban–rural
catchment areas provides a spatial and functional
representation of the connection between rural
areas and urban centres, giving new insights into the
degree of connectivity between rural and urban areas
and the diversity of patterns in rural–urban linkages
around the world. Spatial representation refers to
the geographical and locational distribution of the
population (i.e. what area it occurs in and how spread
out it is). Functional representation entails how
these areas relate to each other in terms of activities
and purpose (i.e. access of rural locations to urban
services and opportunities, captured by the size of
the closest urban centre and the associated travel
time from the rural location). This categorization,
when combined with household survey data, allows
for a more detailed analysis regarding consumption
and production across the rural–urban continuum
(see Chapter 4).

Figure 18 conceptualizes two divergent patterns of
urbanization and their major impacts (see Box 3
for definitions of city sizes), which ultimately
determine the availability and affordability of
healthy diets.3 The degree of connectivity between
rural and urban areas shapes agrifood systems,
and thus the availability of affordable healthy
diets, and the livelihoods of urban and rural
primary producers, processors and traders.3
Rural agricultural livelihoods often depend on
their connection to peri-urban and urban food
spaces, while cities depend on surrounding
peri-urban and rural areas for food and ecosystem
services. For example, in many parts of Africa,
agriculture often flourishes in close proximity to
urban centres through more intensive production
of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables,
which are highly perishable. In this case, farmers
can take advantage of this proximity to markets
for both inputs and post-harvest products
and services.3, 40

inputs (Figure 18). This is because intermediate and
small cities, also referred to as “secondary cities”,m
play a pivotal role in providing input and output
market opportunities for rural populations not
residing close to the large cities. Infrastructure
and facilities in intermediate and small cities are
important for connecting different urban centres
with each other and with rural areas, thereby
facilitating access to more dispersed patterns
of pre-harvest and post-harvest facilities such
as collection hubs, (cold) storage facilities, and
distribution and processing centres.45, 46
Several studies find that the growth of
intermediate and small cities may matter even
more than the growth of large cities in reducing
poverty nationally.47, 48, 49 Population growth
m Secondary cities are geographically defined urban jurisdictions or
centres performing vital governance, logistical and production functions
at a subnational or submetropolitan regional level within a system of
cities in a country. Secondary cities range in size from 100 000 to
1 000 000 people or more in some of the more populated countries, and
they are centres of subnational government, logistics, employment and
services.43, 44
in large cities seems to have little effect on
poverty reduction, and even increases poverty
in some cases, while decreasing levels of urban
food security.50 For these reasons, several local,
national and international policies have explicitly
promoted the growth of such intermediate and
small cities.51
As rural and urban areas represent two ends of a
spectrum, a rural–urban continuum framework
is therefore critical to understand the links
between urbanization and agrifood systems
changes and how these changes are affecting the
availability and affordability of healthy diets,
and in turn, food security and nutrition. With
this in mind, the global Urban Rural Catchment
Areas (URCA) dataset suggests that the breadth
of services and opportunities available, as well as
their accessibility to rural locations, are often a
function of the size of nearby urban centres and
the associated travel time from rural locations
(see Box 2 and Annex 4 for a full description of the
data and the definition of URCA categories).
 BOX 3 DEFINITIONS OF URBAN, PERI-URBAN AND RURAL AREAS IN URBAN–RURAL CATCHMENT AREAS
(URCAs)
The definition of city size and type differs widely
among countries. Numerous designations are given
indicating size and function, such as primary,
secondary or tertiary cities, indicating the role of a
city within a national context.
There is also no standard definition of peri-urban,
and the term is applied to a diverse mix of informal
and formal settlements around urban areas.41, 42
In general, however, peri-urban refers to the
geographical edge of a city – the “urban fringe”
outside the formal city limits. It is often described as
the landscape interface or transition zone between
urban and rural areas.
For the purposes of the discussion and analysis
in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this report, the terminology
utilizes URCA definitions to define urban, peri-urban
and rural areas.
Based on combined URCA urban area
subcategories, urban areas are defined according to
the following population sizes:
 Large cities: >1 million people.
 Intermediate cities: 0.25–1 million people.
 Small cities: 50–250 thousand people.
 Towns: 20–50 thousand people.
Furthermore, based on URCA subcategories,
peri-urban and rural areas are defined as follows:
 Peri-urban areas consist of three URCA
subcategories: <1 hour to a large city; <1 hour to an
intermediate city; <1 hour to a small city.
 Rural areas also consist of three URCA
subcategories: <1 hour to a town; 1–2 hours to a city
or town; >2 hours to a city or town.
See Annex 4 for further details on the URCA
methodology.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Figure 19A shows a global mapping of the URCA
categories around the world and Figure 19B
shows the global population distribution of
URCA categories by country income group and
regional group. The URCA mapping reveals
disparities in access to services, with around
3.4 billion people living in peri-urban and rural
locations (Figure 19) (see Box 3 for specific URCAs).
Around one-fourth of the global population
live in peri-urban areas (less than 1 hour to an
urban centre) of intermediate and small cities
and towns, which challenges the centrality of
large cities to development, as well as to the
transformation of agrifood systems (Figure 19B).
Intermediate and small cities appear to provide
catchment areas for proportionately more
people gravitating around them compared to
larger cities, emphasizing their importance
(as conceptualized in Figure 18). Similarly,
in low-income countries, 64 percent of the
population live either in small cities and towns
or within their catchment areas (i.e. locations
that gravitate around a specific urban centre
in terms of access to markets, services and
employment opportunities). All told, almost
half of the global population (47 percent) live
in peri-urban areas (less than 1 hour to large,
intermediate and small cities or towns)n and
rural areas (1 to 2 hours or more to an urban
centre). Given the increasing connectivity of
peri-urban and rural areas and the convergence
n Note for the purposes of the selected country analyses in Chapter 4,
small cities and towns are split into two separate categories and periurban areas are defined as less than 1 hour travel to a city of any size
(i.e. towns are excluded). This facilitates representation of the analysis
of the selected countries in Africa studied in Chapter 4.

URBANIZATION AFFECTS
AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS,
CREATING CHALLENGES
AND OPPORTUNITIES
TO ENSURE ACCESS
TO AFFORDABLE
HEALTHY DIETS
Urbanization contributes to the transformation
of agrifood systems by reshaping spatial
patterns of food demand and affecting consumer
preferences, changing how, where and what
food is produced, supplied and consumed.
These changes are affecting agrifood systems
in ways that are creating both challenges and
opportunities to ensure everyone has access to
affordable healthy diets.
With urbanization and rising incomes,
households often eat greater and more diverse
quantities of food, including dairy, fish, meat,
legumes, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as
more processed foods.52, 53, 54, 55 This, together
with population growth, implies substantial
increases in the production and supply of some
types of foods (i.e. meat, dairy, fresh fruits and
vegetables, wheat and wheat products, as well
as highly processed foods) to satisfy increased
demand. This, in turn, as urban populations
grow, translates into vast increases in the total
amount of food that agrifood systems have to
produce, process and distribute over time. There
may also be slower growth or even declines in
demand for other food products sold such as
traditional grains, maize, roots and tubers.
Adjustments in the quantity and quality of food
demand and supply bring about changes in
markets and retail trade; midstream food supply
chains (changes in post-harvest systems for
logistics, processing, wholesale and distribution);
rural input markets; agricultural technology; and
the size distribution of farms.14, 56 Thus, agrifood
systems are transformed, from traditional and
mostly rural systems based on local market
linkages and farming employment, to systems
with greater connectivity between rural areas,
and between rural, peri-urban and urban
areas. This entails more complex rural–urban
market linkages across a spatial and functional
rural–urban continuum, and more diverse
employment opportunities along the food value
chain, including processing, marketing and trade.
It also entails more dependence on income and
food pricing (affordability) for dietary choices, as
there is a greater dependence on purchased foods.
Of specific concern against this backdrop are the
changes in the supply and demand of nutritious
foods that constitute a healthy diet; their cost
relative to foods of high energy density and
minimal nutritional value, which are often high in
fats, sugars and/or salt; and their cost relative to
people’s income (i.e. their affordability).
Figure 20 presents a conceptual framework for
understanding the different pathways through
which urbanization is driving changes in agrifood
systems across the rural–urban continuum, and is,
in turn, affecting access to affordable healthy diets.
The orange text throughout this section refers
to specific elements in Figure 20 for emphasis
and to ease cross-referencing with the figure.
The framework was developed based on a
systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence
from scientific studieso
 and informed by new
analysis presented in Chapter 4 on changes in
food demand and supply across the rural–urban
continuum. Figure 20 recognizes that urbanization
is not an agrifood systems driver in isolation but
that it changes agrifood systems in interaction
with other drivers including income growth,
employment, lifestyles, economic inequality, policies and
investments.
o The design of this review is based on the design as suggested in the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis
(PRISMA) guidelines, but is adapted making use of FAO’s Data Lab,
which automatizes searches of scientific articles and identifies the most
relevant ones through an artificial intelligence method that learns from
users’ selections and extends the assessment to other articles.
A description of the tool and approach is available in Annex 4.

CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
This conceptual framework stipulates that in
addition to rural areas, food can also be produced
in urban and peri-urban areas. In many countries,
the components of agrifood systems are more
interconnected. There are also both short and
long food supply chains, and there can be a
dislocation of midstream processing away from
urban areas as part of very long supply chains.
For these reasons, the conceptual framework
does not visualize the rural–urban continuum
alongside the agrifood systems continuum;
it is a broader continuum in which agrifood
systems can be placed.
Figure 20 depicts the ways in which urbanization
is affecting three major components of agrifood
systems: i) consumer behaviour and diets; ii) midstream
(e.g. logistics, processing and wholesale) and
downstream (e.g. markets, retail and trade) food
supply chains; and iii) food production. The figure

presents these three components in the standard
order for conceptualizing agrifood systems and
food supply chains. However, the following
sections start at the other end with consumer
behaviour and diets, as this is one of the most
important pathways through which urbanization
is driving changes in agrifood systems. Changes
across agrifood systems also impact food
environments which here refer to physical,
economic, sociocultural and policy conditions
that shape access, affordability, safety and food
preferences.57, 58, 59, 60
Moreover, as illustrated in Figure 20 and expanded
on below, food environments reflect a complex
interplay among supply-side drivers including
food pricing, product placement and promotion,
and demand-side drivers including consumer
preferences and purchasing power. Together
this complex interplay of supply and demand
considerations is key to understand how
urbanization is driving changes in agrifood
systems across the rural–urban continuum,
affecting access to affordable healthy diets.
Consumer behaviour and diets
One of the most important pathways through
which urbanization is driving changes in agrifood
systems is through a shift in consumer behaviour and
diets (Figure 20). Higher average incomes, combined
with changing lifestyles and employment,
are driving a dietary transition. While this is
occurring in countries and regions at different
speeds and with variations, it is happening
around the world. This transition is characterized
by changes in the types and quantities of food
consumed, with diets shifting beyond traditional
grains into dairy, fish, meat, vegetables and fruits,
but also into consumption of more processed
foodsp and convenience foods or food away from
home. These changing preferences are reinforced
by the greater diversity of both food products and
p Food processing can facilitate the promotion of high-quality diets,
as it can make food more available as well as safer. However, highly
processed foods can contain very high densities of salt, free sugars and
saturated or trans fats, and these products, when consumed in high
amounts, can undermine diet quality. Free sugars are all sugars added
to foods or drinks by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, as well as
sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice
concentrates. For further information, see Annex 5, Section C
(“Explanatory note on processed foods and food processing
classification systems”).
places to buy food in urban food environments,
ranging from supermarkets to informal markets,
food street vendors and restaurants.61 The
increased availability of these options often
results in increased food consumption and dietary
diversity. Dietary preferences are also shaped
by marketing and other supply factors, with
a reinforcing compounding effect on the food
produced, supplied and consumed.
However, urbanization has also contributed to
the spread and consumption of processed and highly
processed foods, which are increasingly cheap,
readily available and marketed, with private
sector small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
and larger companies often setting the nutrition
landscape. Cost comparisons of individual food
items and/or food groups from existing studies
indicate that the cost of nutritious foods – such
as fruits, vegetables and animal source foods – is
typically higher than the cost of energy-dense
foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt, and of
staple foods, oils and sugars.62, 63, 64, 65 The relative
prices of nutritious foods and foods of high
energy density and minimal nutritional value
have also been shown to differ systematically
across income levels and regions.62, 66, 67
With urbanization, purchases from supermarkets,
fastfood takeaway outlets, home deliveries and
e-suppliers and other convenience retailers
are increasing.68, 69, 70 In Latin America and the
Caribbean, for example, there has been a profound
shift in the last 20 years towards foods of high
energy density and minimal nutritional value,
including sugar-sweetened beverages. While this
phenomenon occurs predominately in urban and
peri-urban areas, it is spreading to rural areas
and Indigenous Peoples’ lands. There has also
been a shift towards increased consumption
of food away from home and snacking, which
corresponds to high levels of overweight and
obesity among all ages, along with high burdens
of stunting in some countries.69 Such challenges
are not unique to the Latin America and the
Caribbean region, and many settings now face
multiple, simultaneous burdens of different forms
of malnutrition.71, 72
Another reason for the spread of processed
foods is convenience. Urbanization is associated
with changes in the lifestyles and employment

CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
profiles of both women and men, as well as
increasing commuting times, resulting in greater
demand for convenience, pre-prepared and fast foods.
Women, who often bear responsibility for food
preparation, are increasingly working outside
the home, and thus may have less time to shop,
process and prepare food. At the same time, men
are increasingly working far from home in other
cities. These trends are driving the purchase of
pre-prepared or ready-to-eat cereals such as rice
and wheat,73, 74 along with more processed foods
and food away from home prepared by restaurants,
canteens, retailers, etc.18 The food processing
sector and fastfood segment have grown quickly
as a result. For example, eating patterns of
Tanzanian migrants change when they move from
rural to urban areas, away from traditional staple
foods such as cassava and maize, and towards
convenience, ready-to-eat or pre-prepared foods
such as rice, bread and food away from home.75
Increasingly, this trend is also occurring in rural
areas as a time-saving measure for off-farm
labourers and women working outside the home,
facilitated by increased rural incomes, increased
supply of these foods from urban and other rural
areas, and reduced transportation costs because
of better roads.
The diet transition is also occurring in rural areas,
though lagged and to a lesser extent compared
to urban and peri-urban areas. New studies
in the last two years,52, 53, 76 including the new
analysis presented in Chapter 4, underscore
the extent of the diet transition across the
rural–urban continuum and the absence of stark
differences between urban and rural areas within
countries analysed.
There is also a diffusion of food purchases in rural
areas, more so than is commonly understood.
The diet in these areas has shifted from
mainly home-produced foods to increasingly
market-purchased products. The rural poor
are heavily engaged in purchasing food from
markets and are, in general, net food buyers. In
Eastern and Southern Africa, research shows
rural households buy 44 percent (in value
terms) of the food they consume.77 A study of
Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and Viet Nam
shows rural households buy an even higher
proportion of their food – 73 percent (in value
terms).78 Moreover, new research presented in
Chapter 4 also shows that food purchases form
the majority (average 56 percent) of the foods
consumed (in value terms) by rural households
in 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. This is
true even for those households living 1 to 2 hours
from a small city or town (average 56 percent),
and those living more than 2 hours from a city or
town (average 52 percent).
Studies show that while consumption of
processed foods (of all types) is higher in urban
areas, in terms of the proportion of expenditure
on food, rural consumption of processed foods
is not much lower.54, 79 In Eastern and Southern
Africa, for example, 29 percent of total food
outlays are spent on such food, and of these
17 percent are spent on purchased milled
grains classified as minimally processed items,
48 percent on non-grain minimally processed
foods and 35 percent on highly processed
foods.77, 80 Recent evidence from three African
countries shows that the shares of processed
foods of all types are surprisingly high among
the poor and even the ultra-poor, in both rural
and urban areas.52, 53, 54 However, there are
different patterns of consumption of various
types of processed foods across the rural–urban
continuum, with highly processed food and
food away from home shares showing a strong
correlation with total food-budget shares
and urban areas in the 11 sub-Saharan Africa
countries analysed (see Chapter 4).54, 79
Midstream and downstream food
supply chains
Another pathway through which urbanization
is affecting agrifood systems is changes in
midstream and downstream food supply chains
(Figure 20). These changes are often the result of
increased investments in infrastructure such as
roads, warehouses and cold storage facilities.
The midstream consists of the post-farm gate
activities related to the logistics, processing
and wholesale of food. This includes cleaning,
sorting, packaging, transportation, storage
and wholesaling of agricultural and food
products. Downstream food supply chains
involve those segments more directly related to
consumer purchases, that is retail markets and
sales, and trade.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Food supply chains
Urbanization can contribute to longer, more formal
and more complex food supply chains, following rising
consumer demand and increased regulation of
agrifood systems.81, 82 As cities grow and diets
of urban dwellers change, urban populations
increasingly must look beyond local production
for their food supply. Only around 30 percent
of urban residents worldwide are estimated to
fulfil their demand for specific crops locally
(approximately 100 km radius).83, 84 The majority of
urban food demand, about 80 percent, is supplied
regionally (within a 500 km radius).85
Although some of the foods consumed in urban
areas must travel far to reach their destination,
most are produced within national borders and
traded domestically (for example, this share
is 90–95 percent in Asia).80 Exceptions are the
entire Near East and North Africa region, some
countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the
Small Island Developing States. According to
the latest World Trade Organization report,
there are 32 net food-importing developing
countries.86 For these countries, food imports
can be substantial. For example, according to
the OECD–FAO Agricultural Outlook, roughly
70 percent of all food commodities consumed in
the Near East and North Africa are imported.87
For most other countries, imports are a low
share of food supply, and mainly consist of a
few products, such that domestic supply chains
really drive food supply.55 This is consistent
across regions and most food groups (except oils
and fats), and is particularly the case for fruits,
vegetables and animal source foods, which are
important food groups for healthy diets.
Domestic food supply chains are usually long
and criss-cross a country from supply zones to
cities and rural areas.88 Short rural local supply
chains, or traditional food supply chains based
around subsistence agriculture, only account for
approximately 10 percent of the food economy
in Africa and Southern Asia, and 5 percent in
South-eastern Asia and Latin America.76, 88, 89
On the other hand, long supply chains connecting
rural producers to urban consumers through
a web of labour-intensive agrifood SMEs are
more prevalent, accounting for approximately
70 percent of the food economy in Africa and
Southern Asia, and 50 percent in South-eastern
Asia and Latin America.88, 89 Modern food supply
chains based around supermarkets and large
processors tend to be long as well, stretching
from rural areas to urban areas, but they also
include international elements. Such long supply
chains account for approximately 20 percent
of agrifood systems in Africa and Southern
Asia, and 45 percent in South-eastern Asia
and Latin America.
Midstream food supply chains
Midstream food supply chains have become major
supply chain growth engines as a result of the
overall rise in urban food demand and more
specifically the higher demand for high-value
and processed products.90 These supply chains
have grown quickly over several decades and now
constitute a significant share of the total value
added and costs in food value chains. In lowand lower-middle-income countries, midstream
food supply chains form 30 to 40 percent of the
value added in food value chains.80 Additionally,
due to the embeddedness in local economies,
the midstream segments can provide locally
adapted services and market linkages to farmers
contributing to enhancing food supply and
rural economies.91
The past several decades have witnessed a
rapid proliferation of SMEs, which now play
an important role in the transformation of
agrifood value chains in Africa, Asia and
Latin America.91, 92 The spread of SMEs is most
rapid during the transitional stage of this
transformation, when agrifood value chains
develop and grow longer as urbanization
progresses, but remains fragmented (see Table 7
for more detail on the transformation of agrifood
value chains). The absence of appropriate
policies has been a factor hindering the
proliferation of “formal” SMEs, particularly in
the processing sector.91
In sub-Saharan Africa, SMEs operating in
the midstream food value chains procure
95 percent of the total supply for small farms
and have become the largest investors in
agricultural produce markets in the region.93
The productivity of this midstream is, therefore,
as important as farm yields for food security in
poor countries. The post-farm gate segments of
the supply chain – the midstream (processing
| 57 |
CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
and wholesale/transport) and downstream
(retail and food stalls) segments – together
comprise 40 to 70 percent of food costs for urban
Africans.94 Rural areas nearer to cities tend to
experience a more rapid transformation of food
value chains, including the development of the
midstream.80 However, in some low-income and
urbanizing countries, the midstream segments
of agrifood systems are still at an early stage of
transformation. For example, in many countries
in sub-Saharan Africa, most cities still have only
a narrow range of packaged and processed foods,
with the greatest diversity of products available
in the capital or large cities.95, 96, 97
Importantly, growing midstream and downstream
activities provide important off-farm employment
opportunities, which can provide steady and
liveable incomes, increasing the affordability of
healthy diets. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa,
employment in off-farm agrifood systems is
currently growing more rapidly than employment
in farming itself 45 – a clear manifestation of
agrifood systems transformation. Employment
in off-farm activities, most often in SMEs,
includes post-farm gate jobs in food processing,
wholesale, logistics, retail, and food service, as
well as non-agrifood systems jobs. Studies show
that SME employment in agrifood systems in
processing, wholesale, transport and retail can
be especially important to the employment of
women and youth.36, 98 While estimates of the
number of employed people in food supply chains
are scarce, a number of studies have estimated
employment in agrifood systems as a whole for
specific regions and subpopulations. For example,
one study estimates that in Africa, Asia and Latin
America, youth employment rates in agrifood
systems are 61 percent, 39 percent and 48 percent,
respectively.99 Another study in Western Africa
estimates that agrifood systems account for
66 percent of total employment and that processing

and food vending/services are disproportionately
female, with women comprising over 80 percent
of workers in those sectors.45 In the fisheries and
aquaculture sector, women represent 50 percent of
those employed in the entire aquatic value chain
(including pre- and post-harvest).100
Furthermore, several studies highlight
that especially in low- and middle-income
countries, where agrifood systems employ the
largest number of workers, agrifood systems
transformation offers the promise of new jobs
both downstream and midstream, particularly for
large, young populations.101, 102, 103 A new study
estimates that total employment in agrifood
systems was 1.23 billion people worldwide in
2019.104, 105 Total agrifood systems employment
in Africa is estimated at 62 percent, compared
with 40 percent in Asia and 23 percent in the
Americas. While the study does not disaggregate
employment by the different components of
agrifood systems, it does separate out employment
related to food supply trade and transportation.
Of the 1.23 billion people employed in agrifood
systems, 375 million are in jobs related to food
supply, trade and transportation. The inclusion
of trade and transportation jobs has the
biggest impact in Africa, where the share of
non-agricultural jobs in agrifood systems is
between 5 percent and 14 percent. Across all
other regions, the share ranges from 8 percent in
Europe to 14 percent in Africa.104, 105
Changing urban food markets: the rise of
supermarkets and highly processed foods
Urbanization results in an increase in the number
and size of urban food markets. Both formal
and informal food market outlets have been
expanding with city growth, owing to the
demand and purchasing power of urban
residents as well as to public and private
investments in these markets. A study in Eastern
and Southern Africa estimates the growth of
urban markets in the two regions at between
600 percent and 800 percent over the last four
decades.90 A study of South-eastern Asia places
growth at roughly 1 000 percent in the same
period.106 Urbanization and changing agrifood
systems have also given rise to both food deserts
and swamps, which are characterized by markets
that provide poor access to or limited availability
of diverse and nutritious foods (Box 4).
 BOX 4 FOOD DESERTS AND SWAMPS
Urbanization and changing agrifood systems have
given rise to two new types of food environments:
food deserts and food swamps. Food deserts
are geographic areas where residents’ access to
diverse, fresh or nutritious foods is limited or even
non-existent, due to the absence or low density
of “food entry points” within a practical travelling
distance. Food swamps are areas where there is an
overabundance of foods of high energy density and
minimal nutritional value. They offer few options for
affordable, nutritious foods.
Although both concepts have been criticized for
their narrow and inappropriate meaning in certain
contexts,110 urbanization can affect the accessibility
of both healthy and unhealthy diets, especially in
expanding informal neighbourhoods. While a new
and growing phenomenon in urban slums of lowand middle-income countries, this problem was
already well established in poorer neighbourhoods in
high-income countries.
For example, the rapid growth of Windhoek,
the capital of Namibia, has gone hand in hand with
the rapid growth of informal peri-urban and urban
settlements. These settlements can be defined
as food deserts due to the lack of nutritious foods
for most inhabitants.111 In the Mexican city of
Mazatlán, in contrast, low- and middle-income
neighbourhoods, with a very high density of very
small, informal businesses selling energy-dense
snacks, quick meals and sugary drinks, can be
considered food swamps.112 In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
a study found that food deserts and swamps were
simultaneously more prevalent in the lowest-income
neighbourhoods, which had high levels of deprivation
and segregation.113

The formal food sector is characterized by more
formalized supermarkets and chains; they are
regulated and taxed by governments at various
scales, and – unlike informal markets – are
able to afford financial and technical services.
In contrast, the informal food sector can be
broadly defined as all food-related economic
activities that take place in independent, small
and/or unregistered enterprises. Mostly,
there is limited coverage by formal authorities
for monetary, regulatory and institutional
arrangements such as taxation.
Supply-side factors, coupled with an increase
in demand for readily available foods, have
contributed to a substantial expansion of supermarkets
and hypermarkets.
107, 108, 109 These supply factors
include policy liberalization and privatization
in the 1980s and 1990s leading to competitive
domestic investments, public infrastructure
investments that reduced transaction costs for
supply chain development (e.g. procurement
systems), and globalized distribution of
modern technology related to food production,
transportation and marketing, mass media, and
the flow of capital and services. Supermarkets
have been able to attain economies of scale in
procurement, and economies of scale and scope
in marketing, which has allowed them to increase
over time their share of retail compared to small
shops and wet markets (marketplaces selling
fresh foods such as meat, fish, produce and other
consumption-oriented perishable goods in a
non-supermarket setting), especially in Asia and
Latin America.108, 109
Increasingly, supermarkets and hypermarkets
represent the major force contributing to the
diet transition in any country or region. Their
establishment has been facilitated by the increase
in large urban food markets, which both bring
together potential consumers and attract foreign
investments.114 These markets are often part of
multinational chains or, in countries such as
South Africa and China, domestic chains that
function like global chains.
The relationship between urbanization and the
growth of supermarkets differs widely by region
and city size. In Latin America and the Caribbean,
urbanization occurred in the 1980s, before the rise
of supermarkets, and the process was actually
more profoundly linked to privatization and
liberalization of agrifood systems.69 In Asia on the
other hand, supermarket development was closely
correlated with urbanization. Ultimately, the
shift towards more supermarkets has been driven
by a range of factors including rising incomes,
changing lifestyles, marketing and increasing
awareness of food safety and quality.115, 116, 117
While supermarkets can be linked to increased
access to nutritious foods,118 and modern food
technology has provided benefits in terms
of reducing waste, enhancing sanitation and
reducing adverse effects of seasonality,109
they have also been associated with increased
supply of energy-dense and highly processed
foods.
81, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123 The substantial expansion
in the types, varieties and quantities of highly
processed foods sold worldwide can be associated
with the expansion of supermarkets and
hypermarkets, the industrialization of agrifood
systems, technological change, and globalization
including market growth and the political
activities of transnational food corporations.
While there are wide variations between
regions and countries, sales of highly processed
foods are highest in Oceania and the Pacific,
Northern America, Europe and Latin America,
but are also growing rapidly in Asia, the Near
East and Africa.119
Despite the greater penetration of formal markets
such as supermarkets and hypermarkets, open
and wet markets, as well as informal kiosks
and street vendors, are still important for local
urban food cultures in many countries around
the world, particularly in Asia and Africa.117
Here, the low average annual income per
person is seen as an important limitation for
supermarkets to expand.124
Poor urban dwellers especially buy most
of their food at informal markets or street
shops. For example, supermarkets account
for only 3 percent and 0.4 percent of all food
expenditure of slum dwellers in Nairobi and
Kampala, respectively.125 In Zambia, the share
of supermarkets is lower in small cities than in
larger cities.126 Despite a greater penetration of
formal markets, informal food retailers – such
as street and market traders and small-scale
shops – remain abundant across the African
»

CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
continent as well as in many Asian countries.117
In Latin America and the Caribbean, street
markets and wholesale markets are also still
relevant, especially for fresh foods.127, 128, 129
In places where supermarkets are expanding,
this process affects prices, quality and safety
standards, often restricting access to sales
channels for small producers.130, 131
Food production
Urbanization, in particular, by increasing the
connectivity of rural and urban areas, also
affects agrifood systems through changes in
agricultural production (Figure 20). As consumer
behaviour and diets change, this influences
agricultural production and diversification, with
shifts in intensity and type of production factors
(i.e. labour, land and other natural resources).
Furthermore, as already highlighted, this has a
reinforcing compounding effect – as food supply
changes in turn influence consumer behaviour
and choices, which further affect food production.
Food production, production factors and
agricultural services
Urbanization is often associated with a
diversification of diets, including dairy, fish, meat,
vegetables, fruits and legumes – foods that help
constitute a healthy diet, as already highlighted
above. However, the availability of vegetables and
fruits, in particular,q is insufficient to meet the
daily dietary requirements in almost every region
of the world (Table 8). Particularly concerning is the
insufficient availability of all food groups apart
from staple foods in Africa. There are, however,
notable differences across countries and within
regions. For example, the supply of vegetables is
more than adequate in Asia.55
Urbanization affects agricultural production in
different ways across the rural–urban continuum.
In rural and peri-urban regions that are well
connected to expanding urban markets or storage
and processing facilities, small- and large-scale
farmers are increasingly commercial and
relatively well served by agribusinesses providing
inputs and farm output marketing services.133
Farmers located close to urban markets often
receive higher returns on their agricultural
products and benefit most from growing markets
for diversified high-value products.134, 135
As urban areas become better connected to rural
areas, rural producers may also have better access
to agricultural inputs and services, allowing for improved
productivity that typically increases income levels,
136
q This finding is aligned with an analysis in the 2020 edition of this
report,62 which showed that the availability of fruits and vegetables for
human consumption was below 400 g per capita per day, which is the
recommended amount in FAO and World Health Organization guiding
principles of a healthy diet.132 Further research is needed to determine
the reasons behind these results.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
which is key to increase access to nutritious
foods. For instance, in Meru, United Republic
of Tanzania, urbanization has stimulated the
demand for milk, providing a reliable source
of income for smallholders in a region facing
a scarcity of (fertile) land.137 Improved access
to inputs and the support of stable institutions
were important conditions that facilitated this
intensification, resulting in higher incomes.
The effects of urbanization can spread to
agricultural zones quite far from towns and cities,
depending on the connectivity between rural and
urban areas, which is shaped by the proximity
to cities and by existing transport routes.138
This can be seen in the rural regions around
Delhi, India. Vegetables and dairy products are
becoming increasingly important components
of consumption not only in high-income urban
households, but also in low- and middle-income
urban households. As a result of these changes
in urban consumption, the rural areas around
Delhi, which used to be cultivated with cereals,
are now increasingly being diversified to
vegetable production and livestock keeping,
and productivity is rising.139 The far-reaching
influence of urbanization is also seen in fisheries,
where it has impacted fishers' ability to meet the
rising cost of living in fishing communities.140
At the same time, millions of smallholders in less
accessible or detached hinterlands remain cut
off from the opportunities that growing urban
food markets can bring.141 In more isolated rural
areas, agricultural growth is limited due to low
productivity and high transportation costs.138
Farmers with limited access to urban markets
have few opportunities to profit from urban
development. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa,
the adoption of high-input technology and crop
productivity is found to be negatively correlated
with travel time to urban centres.142
Another important direct impact of urban
expansion is land-use change. In some countries,
farmers receive high compensation for selling
their land,143 whereas in others, dispossession of
agricultural land is not compensated, resulting
in a loss of livelihoods and issues around land
rights. As farms in peri-urban areas make
voluntary or involuntary room for urban
expansion and associated infrastructure, they
often move farther away from cities and convert
more remote natural areas (mostly forests and
scrublands) into new farmland, negatively
affecting habitat quality and biodiversity,
and causing environmental degradation and
deforestation.144, 145, 146, 147 In some cases, farmers
are driven to use less productive lands in more
remote villages, or are restricted to unauthorized
public spaces.148, 149 What is more, converted lands
are less fertile than arable lands around cities,
leading to a loss in agricultural productivity that
is higher than the absolute loss of land.150 Meeting
food production and demand for an urbanizing
population when land availability and quality are
reduced requires agricultural intensification; this
implies intensive use of energy, land and water,
which if not managed to mitigate against climate
change, can lead to an increase in greenhouse gas
emissions.151, 152, 153, 154
With urbanization continuing, the resultant loss
of cropland is expected to be 3 percent in the
whole of Asia and Africa by 2030. The production
loss, however, is 6 and 9 percent (respectively),
because (as stated above) agricultural land around
cities is often more fertile – an important reason
why cities historically developed where they did.
Additionally, farmers close to cities are often
more productive due to higher input use and
knowledge levels.150 Therefore, the productivity
loss is higher than the absolute loss of land. In
most countries, production is relocated, although
this is not possible everywhere – in Egypt,
for instance, the amount of arable and fertile
land is limited.155
Urbanization can also affect farm size in various
ways. Impacts depend on land tenure security,
non-farm opportunities, and the magnitude and
impact of land purchases by urban buyers.133, 138
In low-income countries, farm sizes have
decreased from an average of 2.1 hectares in 1960
to 1.3 hectares in 2010, due to rural population
growth (and subsequent outmigration as part of
urbanization).156 In general, farm sizes decrease
until off-farm opportunities, often in cities,
expand sufficiently to absorb new workers. Asia
has now passed this turning point so its average
farm sizes can rise, while in Africa average
farm sizes are expected to continue to fall in
many countries138 – although in some areas they
are rising. In sub-Saharan Africa, the growing
| 63 |
CHAPTER 3 URBANIZATION IS TRANSFORMING AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS <...>
acquisition of farmland by urban buyers has
increased average farm sizes compared to other
African countries.15
How urbanization affects access to
affordable healthy diets, food security
and nutrition
Urbanization can have both positive and
negative impacts on access to affordable
healthy diets and on food security and
nutrition across the rural–urban continuum.
Linkages between urbanization and access to
affordable healthy diets are not unequivocal:
observations depend highly on local or national
context-specific dynamics, including investments
in agrifood systems as well as in rural and
urban infrastructure, training and education,
and economic policies. There are however
some important overarching challenges and
opportunities concerning urbanization across
the rural–urban continuum. Figure 21 summarizes
the most important of these, drawing from
the previous sections on how urbanization is
affecting agrifood systems, as well as further
empirical evidence and studies. Although the
challenges outnumber the opportunities, this
is not per se the case for the magnitude of the
impacts on access to affordable healthy diets.
In recent years, many studies have focused
on urbanization and agrifood systems
transformation; nevertheless there is limited
common understanding of how the nexus
of these two processes affects both access to
affordable healthy diets and food security and
nutrition, and even fewer studies have applied
a rural–urban continuum lens. Data to support
such a disaggregated rural–urban continuum
analysis are extremely limited; the analysis
requires household survey data with geospatial
locational data, and for most countries in the
world such data are not readily available.
Chapter 4 explores this question through a new
analysis on variations in food demand, economic
access to healthy diets, and food security and
nutrition across the rural–urban continuum,
using selected country case studies as far as data
availability allowed.
What we do know is that empirical evidence
reveals socioeconomic disparities in access
to affordable healthy diets throughout the
rural–urban continuum as a result of a number of
structural challenges.62, 157 These include economic
challenges related to the high cost of nutritious
foods (Figure 21), which varies within countries
and can be even higher in poor neighbourhoods.
For urban populations living in poverty, the
most easily available and affordable diets tend
to be unhealthy.158 Access to nutritious foods is
often limited, as these types of foods are more
expensive, or in some cases unavailable, in more
urbanized areas. Poorer households are inclined
to prioritize meeting dietary energy requirements
over nutritional quality, spending their resources
on more affordable foods, which tend to be of
high energy density and minimal nutritional
value.158, 159 Other structural barriers are found in
agrifood supply systems and markets, impeding
physical access to healthy diets (resulting in food
deserts and swamps in urban areas, for example).
For other income groups of urban dwellers,
an important challenge to access to affordable
healthy diets is that urban centres have more
supermarkets and especially fastfood chains,
including multinational outlets, offering a
ready and abundant supply of highly processed
foods, as well as energy-dense snacks, sweets,
and sugar-sweetened beverages (Figure 21).
These developments have negatively affected
obesity levels and health conditions of urban
dwellers.160, 161 It is important to note that while
supermarkets have an advantage in selling highly
processed foods because of economies of scale, a
growing number of small shops are also selling
these products.54, 69 The rapidly increasing share
of highly processed foods of high energy density
and minimal nutritional value, especially in
urban consumption patterns, is linked to the rise
in obesity and non-communicable diseases.54
In many countries, obesity levels have risen
alongside urbanization. New evidence for Africa
suggests that consumption of highly processed
foods and high-calorie snacks and beverages
is spreading across the full spectrum of the
rural–urban continuum, even among the rural
poor – a trend of great concern (see Section 4.1).
Recent empirical studies show that the risk of
food insecurity can even be higher in urban
areas than in rural areas, due to the intra-urban
inequalities present in many rapidly urbanized »

peri-urban areas is similar to (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire,
Senegal) or sometimes even higher than
(e.g. Niger, Nigeria) that in rural areas. Access
to food – nutritious foods in particular – across
the rural–urban continuum is complex, with
multiple determinants. It cannot be assumed
that this access is always better for populations
in urban areas. In fact, several studies show
that the so-called “urban advantage” does not
benefit the poorest, who – on the contrary –
face disproportionate barriers to accessing and
consuming a healthy diet and have an increased
risk of food insecurity and malnutrition.157
Furthermore, when migration decisions reflect
the push factors in rural areas (e.g. conflict or
lack of access to land) rather than the pull of
better opportunities in urban areas, food security
and nutrition outcomes can be compromised
(Figure 21).10 Challenges around accessing food and
the risk of food insecurity among rural–urban
migrants are intensified during crises.163, 164, 165
Rural–urban migrants who often inhabit informal
settlements lack social protection coverage and
their neighbourhoods often fall outside the remit
of urban planning. The COVID-19 pandemic is an
example of a situation in which low-income and
informal rural–urban migrants experienced food
insecurity in cities.
Food insecurity in urban areas is strongly driven
by income limitations; low-income households
need to allocate a high proportion of their total
expenditure to food and are extremely vulnerable
to external shocks including unemployment,
health problems and food price inflation.157
Food insecurity can be further compounded by
poor health, as low-income urban households
tend to have poor sanitation and a low standard
of other essential housing infrastructure and
goods.166, 167, 168 Urban poverty poses diverse
challenges that prevent access to healthy diets
(e.g. unplanned built environments), and
challenging social network structures often
prevent low-income households from finding
strategies to cope with food insecurity. Social
protection and food assistance programmes
designed to facilitate food access – such as
monetary or in-kind transfer schemes, community
kitchens and food banks – are often insufficient
by themselves to fully resolve food insecurity
problems, because they do not address barriers
such as lack of cooking facilities or food storage,
and competing health or housing expenses.
On the other hand, in rural areas, urbanization
can provide opportunities for on- and off-farm
employment (Figure 21), thus increasing purchasing
power and options to access healthy diets.
Especially in rural communities where agriculture
completely dominates the economy, the growth
of small cities and towns can play an important
role in providing access to inputs, markets and
non-farm activities, thus reducing poverty and
improving food security.169 However, there are
also risks of losing or decreasing opportunities
to sustain livelihoods due to formalization
processes. For example, fees for stalls in formal
markets are often relatively expensive, which
decreases the accessibility of these markets for
many small-scale farmers and traders. Nearly
all smallholder farmers, most traders in food
markets and many micro- and small-scale food
processors and food retailers are not part of the
formal food economy in sub-Saharan Africa,170
and improvements in formal markets will not
benefit these actors. Thus there is a risk that
smallholders, small-scale food processors and
food retailers be excluded from formalizing
value chains. Understanding how to best sustain
informal value chains is critical; however, this
knowledge is often lacking.171
The rural-to-urban outmigration of young
people, often men, also poses both challenges
and opportunities in terms of improving
access to affordable healthy diets (Figure 21).
In some contexts, rural outmigration can result
in substantial remittances that increase the
accessibility of healthy diets and improve
food security in rural areas.172, 173 Households
that receive remittances can be better off in
terms of total income, assets, calorie supply
and micronutrient supply.174 Rural-to-urban
migration can also contribute to resilience in the
communities of origin and further the transfer of
knowledge and other resources besides financial
remittances.175 However, there are instances
where remittances are too low (or even absent)

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
to replace the lost workers with hired labour.176
In such cases, the lost labour and associated
reduction in income or agricultural produce
can result in decreased access to healthy diets,
or in longer working hours for the left-behind
women in subsistence farming to maintain
household food security.
In terms of malnutrition, studies generally show
that rural populations face a higher burden of
child undernutrition than urban populations,177, 178
not only but especially in sub-Saharan Africa, a
subregion where many households still live in
remote rural areas. Studies suggests there are no
fundamental differences in the characteristics that
determine child nutrition outcomes in urban and
rural areas. Instead, differences are explained by
the better urban environment, greater choices and
increased opportunities related to socioeconomic
characteristics, from maternal and spousal
education, wealth, and employment, to social and
family networks, as well as access to health care
and other services.
Urbanization typically entails improved access
to non-food markets and services that are
important for nutrition, including schools,
health clinics and non-farm labour markets that
improve income stability.177, 178, 179 Furthermore,
proximity to towns can also weaken the
relationship between agricultural shocks and
child nutrition.180, 181 More recently, studies
find that “market access” can be an important
determinant of dietary diversity and hence child
nutrition outcomes.182, 183, 184 There is relatively
little research, however, on the degree to which
rural populations have access to urban markets
and services and the associated differences in
nutrition seen across rural and urban populations,
or across gradients of rural remoteness.185
One such study, which examined the linkages
between child nutrition and urbanization and
proximity to large urban centres in sub-Saharan
Africa,185 found that rural populations are
characterized by worse nutrition outcomes than
urban populations, but it also produced the
somewhat unexpected result that the nutrition
outcomes of more remote rural populations are
not substantially worse than those of less remote
rural populations. This finding is also aligned
with new analysis (presented in Section 4.2) of
child stunting and wasting, which looks at rural
catchment areas of varying travel times to the
nearest town or city in three sub-Saharan African
countries. Furthermore, and broadly in keeping
with previous analyses of rural–urban inequality
in nutrition, it appears that the majority of
this nutritional disadvantage is explained by
differences in wealth, education, health and
non-road infrastructure services across rural
and urban areas.185
In conclusion, access to affordable healthy diets is
generally better and food security and nutrition
levels are higher in cities than in rural areas
because of the better availability of food, higher
average purchasing power in urban areas, and
better access to health care, education and other
services that are essential for health and nutrition.
However, this does not always hold true given the
transformations underway in agrifood systems,
the stark inequalities that exist within urban
populations, and the increasingly spatial and
functional connectivity between cities, towns and
rural catchment areas.185, 186 New evidence from
11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa presented in
Section 4.2 suggests that the “urban advantage” in
accessing affordable healthy diets, food security
and nutrition may not be as great as expected.
Thus, it will be increasingly important to analyse
these across the rural–urban continuum, and
to understand the patterns of urbanization and
connectivity across the rural–urban continuum in
order to identify the challenges and opportunities
for ensuring access to affordable healthy diets,
to improve food security and nutrition for all. n

CHAPTER 4
THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD
SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND
THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY
OF HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS
THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
As highlighted in Chapter 3, a thorough
understanding of how urbanization is driving
changes in agrifood systems that affect the
availability and affordability of healthy diets is
only possible through a rural–urban continuum
lens. As seen in Chapter 3 and illustrated in
Figure 20, food environments reflect a complex
interplay among supply-side drivers including
food pricing, product placement and promotion,
and demand-side drivers including consumer
preferences and purchasing power.
Together this complex interplay of supply
and demand in agrifood systems is key to
understanding how urbanization is affecting
access to affordable healthy diets across the
rural–urban continuum. A more nuanced
georeferenced mapping of the spatial and
functional connectivity across the rural–urban
continuum, using the newly available FAO Urban
Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) global dataset
(see Chapter 3 and Box 2), thus becomes a key tool
to arrive at such a thorough understanding.
This chapter contributes new evidence on how
urbanization is changing food supply and
demand across the rural–urban continuum,
drawing from analysis utilizing the URCA
data combined with georeferenced household
survey data (Section 4.1). This is followed by
additional analysis for selected countries that
explores differences in the cost and affordability
of a healthy diet (CoAHD), food insecurity,
and different forms of malnutrition across
the URCA-defined rural–urban continuum
(Section 4.2). n

UNDERSTANDING
FOOD SUPPLY AND
DEMAND ACROSS
THE RURAL–URBAN
CONTINUUM
 KEY MESSAGES
è New evidence for 11 Western, Eastern and Southern
African countries shows that while high shares of food
purchases among households living in urban centres are
expected (78–97 percent), shares are surprisingly high
across the rural–urban continuum. This is the case even
for rural households living 1 to 2 hours (56 percent) and
more than 2 hours (52 percent) from an urban centre.
è Own production is not the main source of food
in rural areas in the 11 African countries. In fact,
the average share of own production represents only
37 percent and 33 percent of total household food
consumption in high- and low-food-budget countries
respectively, dispelling the notion that rural populations
in Africa rely primarily on subsistence farming.
| 69 |
CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
An understanding of the changes occurring in
food supply and demand based on empirical
evidence is crucial for policymakers. This
knowledge is needed to design appropriate
food, agricultural and nutrition policies, as
well as related sector policies such as health,
city and regional planning, and education.
Only through all of these policies can agrifood
systems be leveraged to deliver healthy diets
that are affordable to everyone across the
rural–urban continuum.
While there is a substantial amount of literature
that discusses the effect of urbanization on food
demand,5 sound empirical evidence that looks at
the full spectrum of the rural–urban continuum
is still scarce and limited. To date, the majority
of existing research is based on the descriptive
comparison of food demand between rural and
urban areas. While this research is important, this
simple comparison does not reflect the reality of
changing settlement patterns and demographic
shifts within a rural–urban continuum.
New research suggests that the differences
between urban and rural food demand may not
be as acute as previously thought (see Chapter 3).
However, this research does not provide an
understanding of the magnitude of the differences
in food demand across the full spectrum of the
rural–urban continuum, nor an understanding of
the location-related factors (i.e. where households
live in relation to various points across the
rural–urban continuum), and other household
(e.g. socioeconomic) or food environment factors
that may be driving these differences.
To help bridge this gap, this section presents an
analysis of food demand, defined as household
food consumption (at market value) across the
rural–urban continuum in selected countries,
applying the newly available geospatial URCA
dataset. The URCA classification provides a
more granular lens to explore the interplay of
food supply and demand across the rural–urban
continuum than the Degree of Urbanization
(DEGURBA) classification used in Chapter 2,
which is an official methodology for delineating
urban and rural areas for international and
regional statistical comparisons.
è Given that rural households in the 11 African
countries do not produce the majority of the food value
they consume, the affordability of healthy diets is
equally critical across the rural–urban continuum.
è While the diffusion of processed foods, including highly
processed foods, is already advanced in Asia and Latin
America, it is spreading quickly in Africa as well. In the
11 countries in Africa, rural households are consuming
processed foods, including highly processed foods, across
the rural–urban continuum, even in remote rural areas.
è Highly processed foods are a small proportion of
total purchases and their consumption is higher in urban
areas; however, results show the penetration of highly
processed foods in rural areas, even those living 1 to 2
hours or more from a city or town.
è Moving across the continuum from urban to
rural areas in these countries, there is an increasing
household food consumption value share of staple foods
and pulses, seeds and nuts, and a decreasing value
share of animal source foods and food away from home.
In contrast, shares of vegetables, fruits, and fats and oils
are uniform across the rural–urban continuum.
è While animal source food consumption value shares
are strongly driven by income across the rural–urban
continuum, in contrast, shares of fruits and vegetables
are driven more by access and availability.
As highlighted in Chapter 3, urbanization,
combined with rising incomes, increases in the
opportunity cost of time related to work, lifestyle
changes and demographic shifts, is changing
food demand. These factors together with many
supply-side considerations, including food
pricing, marketing and promotion, among others,
in turn are changing agrifood systems, so there
is a reinforcing compounding effect on the food
produced, supplied and consumed.
Most notably, rapid urbanization is leading to
rising and changing food demand, and shifts
in patterns of food supply1, 2 – especially in
sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, the two
regions exhibiting the highest urbanization rates.

Africa and a 1.7-fold increase in Southern Asia

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
The URCA methodology defines urban centres
across a rural–urban gradient based on
population size and density, whereby the city
size is a proxy for the breadth of services and
opportunities provided by an urban centre.
Uniquely, the URCA dataset also classifies rural
locations using the shortest travel time to an
urban centre, as a proxy for the cost of accessing
goods, services and employment opportunities
(see Chapter 3 and Box 2). There are 30 urban–rural
catchment areas (URCAs) categories in total;
however, for the purpose of the analysis in this
chapter, these are further aggregated into ten
categories (Table 9). To facilitate the presentation
and discussion of the more complex data, some
of the analysis is further aggregated into three
categories for urban, peri-urban and rural
areas (see Table 9).
The URCA global geospatial dataset is mapped
against latitudinal and longitudinal data
of households from the most recent World
Bank Living Standards Measurement Study
(LSMS), making it possible to work with
different categories of catchment areas across
the rural–urban continuum – as defined in
Box 3 in Chapter 3.
The availability of georeferenced household
survey data was a major limiting factor for
selection of countries for this food demand
analysis, as there are currently only a handful of
LSMS datasets that have latitude and longitude
information which is publicly available.r
 All of
these datasets are for Africa; hence the analysis
in this section is limited to country case studies
in that region. However, as an analysis of food
demand across the URCA-defined rural–urban
continuum, it is the first of its kind and provides
insights on the importance of using a rural–urban
continuum lens when analysing other regions.
Given that Africa has the highest share of the
total population unable to afford a healthy
diet (77.5 percent in 2021) (see Chapter 2) and is
lagging behind in food security and nutrition,
focusing on countries of this continent is with
merit in itself, especially as it has one of the
highest rates of urbanization in the world. The
analysis presented below also serves to highlight
the need for further analysis covering other
regions, which will depend on an increased
availability of georeferenced survey data.
To evaluate household food consumption
behaviour, georeferenced data from nationally
representative LSMS surveys covering the period
2018/19 are used for Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte
d’Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, the Niger,
r Most LSMS surveys collect latitude and longitude information for
each household. However, almost all countries do not make these data
publicly available for reasons of privacy.

 The LSMS surveys capture household
food consumption using a seven-day recall.
For the food demand analysis, reported foods
are aggregated into categories based on food
source, food processing level and food group.
Food sources are defined using four categories,
the first three of which are assumed for at-home
consumption, specifically food from own
production, food purchased, and food received as
a gift or as in-kind payment for labour. The value
of food consumption from own food production
and food received as a gift or in-kind is valued
at the market price that households would have
had to pay if they had purchased the same
quantity from the market.27 The fourth category
s These are the only countries that have publicly available LSMS
survey data identifying households by latitude and longitude and an
exhaustive food consumption module, elements which are necessary to
carry out the demand analysis by URCA. Other spatial identifiers were
explored, but they proved to be inaccurate in identifying households by
URCA, so these were not applied. The fact that 9 out of the 11 countries
are located in Western Africa prevented a more balanced subregional
approach.
comprises all foods consumed away from home
(e.g. from street vendors and in restaurants).
The classification of food items by level of food
processing was adapted from the NOVA food
classification system,6, 7 focusing only on those
foods classified as low processed (“processed” in
the NOVA classification) and highly processed.
See Annex 5 for a full description of the datasets
and definitions applied, including descriptions of
food groups and details about food processing.
In the food demand analysis that follows, the
11 countries were classified into two groups
according to their food budget, that is the
market value of the average total household food
consumption per capita per day: high-food-budget
countries (average 2.3 PPP dollars per capita per
day) and low-food-budget countries (average
1.6 PPP dollars per capita per day) (Table 10).
Countries were first ranked based on average
food budget and then split into high- and
low-food-budget countries. Countries were
split into the two groups with no reference to

a benchmark, but they depict a cross-section
of African countries from the perspective of
different levels of development in terms of
average total household food consumption,
which also roughly correlates with average total
household expenditure, a proxy for household
income (Table 10). They fell roughly into above
and below 2 PPP dollars per capita per day
food budget.t, u
Moreover, there is an assumption that the
differences in food budgets will lead to different
patterns of consumption. This is based on a
well-established economic law, referred to as
Bennett’s law,v, 8 which stipulates that diets become
more diversified with higher levels of food
consumption, income and employment. Thus, the
differences in food consumption point to larger
food budgets providing “room” for additions
beyond staple foods with increasing expenditure on
non-staple products (as Bennett’s law predicts) as
well as on industrially (rather than home) processed
food products that reduce the opportunity cost of
time for women and men engaged in employment
(see Chapter 3). Usually higher food budgets are
correlated with both of these consumption changes,
and the two sets of countries allow this correlation
to be tested. This is of particular relevance when
seeking to understand how urbanization is driving
changes in agrifood systems and how this is likely
to affect food demand and access to healthy diets,
as we shall see next.
t Ranking and classifying countries by income is not as relevant for a
food demand analysis, because some countries have high incomes
linked to the non-farm sector, and these incomes are spent on non-food
items. It is also not useful to rank and classify countries by the share of
food in total expenditure, for a similar reason: higher income usually
leads to lower food share (Engel’s law), but the food share can vary for
non-income reasons, and thus it does not matter.
u The country “split” occurs at a food budget of roughly USD 2 per
capita per day. Coincidentally, it may be noticed that this split point is
not far from the new World Bank extreme poverty line of USD 2.15 per
capita per day; however, the two are in no way related, as poverty lines
are income based. The list of countries analysed for this report is based
only on LSMS availability, and represents neither a random sample nor
the totality of countries in Africa.
v In agricultural economics and development economics, Bennett’s
law is well established, based on the observation that as incomes rise,
people eat relatively fewer staples and relatively more non-staples
including some nutrient-dense foods (e.g. meats, fruits and
vegetables).
8 Bennett’s law is related to Engel’s law, which considers
the relationship between rising household incomes and total food
spending. Engel’s law, also well established, is related to the
observation that as family income increases, the percentage spent on
food decreases; that spent on clothing, rent, heat and light remains the
same; while that spent on education, health and recreation increases.
The two country food-budget groups add a
further dimension to the analysis that relates
to an ongoing debate about what happens
in countries of high and low per capita food
consumption: Are the latter just traditional, or
are they also changing? One expects to find more
diversified diets and processed foods in urban
areas, as well as in places where there are higher
levels of food consumption per capita, but, as we
shall see below, looking at food demand across
the rural–urban continuum and comparing highand low-food-budget countries, this may not be
the case as a rule. If the patterns of food demand
are the same – between either urban, peri-urban
and rural areas or low- and high-food-budget
countries – this in itself is an important finding.
Indeed, the insights and messages are stronger
if one sees they are happening both across
the rural–urban continuum and in high- and
low-food-budget contexts.
For the 11 African countries analysed, Figure 22
shows the country population distribution across
ten categories (i.e. URCAs) of the rural–urban
continuum (see Table 9 for specific category
grouping). While there are country exceptions
in each group, in general, high-food-budget
countries tend to have a larger share of the
population living in large and intermediate
cities and their surrounding peri-urban areas
(41.5 percent) compared to low-food-budget
countries (34.2 percent).
Furthermore, high-food-budget countries are in
most cases characterized by dense metropolitan
urbanization patterns, while low-food-budget
countries tend to have more dispersed
urbanization patterns around small cities and
towns. Figure 23 provides a mapping that represents
two contrasting patterns of urbanization: dense
metropolitan (e.g. Nigeria) and small city and
town dispersed (e.g. Burkina Faso). The maps
provide a useful visual for “unpacking” the ten
URCA categories (see Annex 6 for maps of other
countries analysed).
As highlighted in Chapter 3, the spatial patterns
and degree of connectivity of rural–urban
linkages determine the impacts of urbanization
on agrifood systems. The analysis presented
below attempts to find empirical evidence
of a “location effect”; that is to say, to test if
| 73 |
CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
the different URCAs across the rural–urban
continuum are contributing determinants of
food demand. An important limitation of this
analysis, however, is that it does not completely
isolate the location effect from other drivers
such as food environment considerations
including, inter alia, the role of industry product
placement and promotion.
In the sections that follow, we explore three
different aspects of food consumption, examining
patterns and their drivers across the rural–urban
continuum for high- and low-food-budget
countries. First, food consumption patterns are
analysed in terms of how households acquire
food, meaning whether the food they consume is
purchased, own-produced, acquired as gifts or
in-kind barter, or purchased as prepared meals
eaten away from home. The extent of consumption
of purchased foods sheds light on the importance
and reach of food supply chains, moving out
from urban areas across the continuum to more
remote rural areas. The conventional view is that
households living in or just outside urban areas
purchase most of their food, whereas households
in rural areas largely produce their own food.

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
Especially in the context of sub-Saharan Africa,
there is a persistent view that households living
in rural areas are subsistent farmers who produce
their own food, with the exception of the landless
poor who are reliant on farm labour and who
purchase or barter to meet some of their food
consumption needs.
Second, food consumption patterns are analysed
in terms of the share of total household food
consumption that is low processed and highly
processed. This analysis can shed some light on
the magnitude and reach of the midstream food
value chains and the associated employment
that this sector generates (see Chapter 3) related
to both low processed and highly processed
foods.w In addition, low processed foods can
provide many advantages to households through
enhanced shelf-life, food safety, convenience,
and in some cases nutritional enhancement
(e.g. fortification). On the other hand, many
highly processed foods are energy dense and
high in fats, sugars and/or salt, and research
suggests that they may contribute to overweight
and obesity as well as some non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) (see Chapter 3). As already
highlighted, it is expected that the consumption
of both low processed and highly processed
foods is higher with higher levels of food
consumption and especially where income and
employment are higher.
Third, household food consumption patterns are
analysed examining the market value of the foods
consumed by food group, which provides insights
into the spread of the consumption of diverse
diets among households across the rural–urban
continuum. Urbanization is generally associated
with a change in consumption behaviour,
with urban households usually eating a more
diversified diet including more expensive foods
such as animal source foods and fruits (see
Chapter 3). However, some studies suggest that it
is higher income, rather than urbanization per se,
that is causing these diet shifts.
w Note a comprehensive overview of processed foods is not provided,
as NOVA Group 1 (unprocessed and minimally processed) is not
analysed.
Food purchases are a major contributor to
household food consumption across the
rural–urban continuum, even among the
rural poor
Across the 11 high- and low-food-budget African
countries, food purchases form the majority of
total household food consumption in value terms,
including food for home consumption and food
consumed away from home (Figure 24). While high
shares of food purchases relative to total food
consumption among households living in urban
areas are to be expected (78–97 percent), shares
are surprisingly high across the rural–urban
continuum, even for rural households living 1 to
2 hours from a small city or town (56 percent on
average) and for those living more than 2 hours
from any urban centre (52 percent on average).
The finding that in most of the countries analysed
the “majority” of household food consumption
in rural households is coming from purchases
(56 percent on average in the 11 countries
analysed) is a major deviation from the traditional
image of rural subsistence households (Box 5).
Indeed, the diffusion of high levels of food
purchases across the rural–urban continuum
(Figure 24) confirms that food markets and supply
chains are important to rural areas in both highand low-food-budget countries. Furthermore,
the average food purchase share for populations
living in rural areas is only slightly lower in
high-food-budget countries (52 percent) than in
low-food-budget countries (57 percent), indicating
a convergence across different patterns of
urbanization and income levels.
As expected, food purchase shares decline
moving from urban to rural areas across the
continuum. The decline is slightly steeper
for low-food-budget countries moving from
urban to peri-urban areas (32 percent decline,
versus 27 percent in high-food-budget
countries), whereas moving from peri-urban
to rural areas the drop is significantly higher
in high-food-budget countries (18 percent
on average) than in low-food-budget
countries (6 percent).
While this pattern over the rural–urban
continuum applies on average, there are variations
between countries depending on the density of

urbanization patterns. For example, there is a
notable increase in purchases in areas less than
1 hour from a town in Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau,
Nigeria and Togo (Figure 24).
Another striking finding is that for four countries,
there is an uptick in food purchases in the
most remote rural areas (more than 2 hours
travel to a city of any size): Mali and Nigeria
(high-food-budget countries), and Benin and

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
Togo (low-food-budget countries). The uptick
in purchases in these areas can be explained
in several ways. First, farmers in remote areas
tend to be poorer, meaning households often
need purchases to “smooth consumption” or
compensate for poor harvests. Second, in furthest
outlying rural areas (more than 2 hours travel
to a city or town), local non-farm employment is
scarce, as are services, and therefore households
focus more on migration to bring in money,
which can be used to buy food. This pattern is
more marked in poorer countries, reflected in
the larger uptick in Benin and Mali, the two
low-food-budget countries.
The traditional view of a rural–urban divide
formed a few decades ago, when most rural
areas in Africa were much poorer and less
connected to urban areas. However, more
recently, the urbanization occurring in many
African countries is dispersed, with growing
networks of interconnected small cities and
towns and increased connectivity with rural
areas. This translates directly to expansive
growth in off-farm employment opportunities,
interconnected food markets and food supply
chains; lifestyles thus change, which in turn
affects how households acquire food and what
foods they eat (see Chapter 3).
Looking to other regions, studies show there
is substantial evidence of high levels of food
purchases in rural areas, for example in Asia,
including studies from Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Nepal and Viet Nam.9, 10 These studies find
similar patterns of food purchases in rural
areas, but the convergence between urban and
rural food purchase patterns is more advanced
than in Africa.
When household income levels are considered,
the notion that rural households in sub-Saharan
Africa rely primarily on subsistence farming
for food still does not hold. The findings show
that food purchases represent 50 percent or
more of total household food consumption
(including own production valued at market
prices) across all income groups in rural
areas of most of the countries, which is by no
means low. The main exception is Ethiopia,
which drags down the average share of food
purchases for high-food-budget countries
(Figure 24). Ethiopia is an outlier case among the
high-food-budget countries, as its pattern of
urbanization “straddles” the divide between
“dense metropolitan” and “small city and town
dispersed” (see Figure A6.1 in Annex 6), with poorer
outlier rural areas not well connected due to very
poor or limited road infrastructure.11
Food purchase shares of low- and middle-income
households are lower overall than the shares of
high-income households across the rural–urban
continuum (Figure 25). The differences are small
in urban areas, but become much bigger in
peri-urban areas less than 1 hour from either a
large city or an intermediate city. This suggests
that while these households still rely on food
purchases, own food production is also important
(Box 5). The pattern holds for both high- and
low-food-budget countries, although food
purchase shares are slightly lower for the latter.
In urban and rural areas, the dispersion of
food purchase shares across household income
groups is smaller than in peri-urban areas,
indicating that household income is less of a
factor driving food purchase shares for urban
and rural households. The only exception is
poor households in more remote rural areas
(more than 2 hours travel to a city or town),
whose food purchase shares are 31 percent and
15 percent less than high-income households in
the same areas of high- and low-food-budget
countries, respectively.
The descriptive analysis presented up until this
point is backed up by an econometric analysis
that looks into the determinants of food purchase
shares for the high- and low-food-budget
countries. Determinants include location
across the rural–urban continuum, household
income, non-farm employment, food prices,x
 age,
education, marital status and gender of the head
of the household, household size, and size of
cultivated land, ownership of assets and animal
stocks. Table A7.1 in Annex 7 presents the full
econometric results. Here we highlight some of
the key findings from this analysis.
x While the focus is on non-price determinants, price variables are
added as control variables to show the location effect across the rural–
urban continuum. As expected, the marginal effect of own prices is
statistically significant.

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
 BOX 5 THE MYTH OF RURAL SUBSISTENCE FARMING IN AFRICA
Especially in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, there
is a persistent view that households living in rural
areas are subsistence farmers who produce their own
food, yet the analysis in this report indicates that this
does not hold true. Using market prices, the value of
food consumption from own production is estimated
here, that is the value that households would pay if
they acquired the same quantity of that food from the
market. Findings show that, moving from urban to
rural areas across the continuum, food consumption
shares of own production grow, with a sharp increase
starting in areas less than 1 hour from a large city
(Figure A1).
And yet, own production never becomes the
main source for food – not even in rural areas.
In rural areas, the average share of own production
represents only 37 percent and 33 percent of total
consumption in high- and low-food-budget countries,
respectively. The shares range from 8 percent to
50 percent in high-food-budget countries, and
from 18 percent to 47 percent in low-food-budget
countries (Figure A1).

NOTES: The figures show household consumption from own production as a percentage share of total household food consumption (at market value)
across the rural–urban continuum (URCA) (Figure A1) and by rural and peri-urban area and household income group (Figure A2). Although URCA is a
categorical variable, it is conceptualized as a spatial continuum, thus the use of a line graph in Figure A1, which also facilitates the presentation of the
results. All surveys are for 2018/19, except Malawi (2019/20). See Annex 5 for the full definition of variables. See Table 10 for the definition and list of highand low-food-budget countries.

Development Economics Technical Study. Rome, FAO.
These surprising findings hold true even
among poor rural households (Figure A2), who
obtain on average 40 percent and 36 percent of
food consumption from own production in highand low-food-budget countries, respectively.
Furthermore, these shares of own production are not
much higher than the shares found for peri-urban
households (i.e. an average of 34 percent in both
high- and low-food-budget countries). Given that
rural households do not produce the majority of the
food value they consume, their capacity to afford a
healthy diet is a key factor to consider regarding their
consumption of nutritious foods.
| 81 |
CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
For both country food-budget groups, there is
statistical confidence about the location effect
across the rural–urban continuum; that is, the
farther from a large city, the lower the share of
purchases in total household food consumption.
As observed in the descriptive analysis, this
pattern is fairly smooth and continuous.
Holding all other factors constant, the effect of
income on the food purchase share is positive in
both sets of countries (excluding Ethiopia, which
shows a negative effect), with a somewhat higher
effect in low-food-budget countries – according
to the supplementary econometric analysis. This
can be interpreted as meaning that households
“start purchasing” at lower income levels in
high-food-budget countries; that is, the transition
of diets in the form of purchasing has spread
more into lower-income households in that group
of countries. This coincides with the findings of
other studies.12
In both country food-budget groups,
furthermore, more non-farm employment (and
hence non-farm income) leads to a higher food
purchase share. This was found reliably in all
country cases and when controlling for gender
(except Guinea-Bissau). Male rural non-farm
employment shows a somewhat stronger effect in
low-food-budget countries (for the reason noted
above). The effect is present but less supported
for female employment in both high- and
low-food-budget countries.
Another important result is that education
of the head of the household, particularly
secondary schooling, even when controlling for
income, is correlated with a higher household
food purchase share. The result is particularly
strong in high-food-budget countries. This
may reflect a variety of factors such as greater
opportunity cost of time (for home production)
in the types of jobs held by the more educated.
In addition, when accounting for gender, there is
a positive effect for female-headed households in
high-food-budget countries, excluding Malawi.
This could again be linked to opportunity cost of
time for women in these households to do both
their own farming and home processing of food,
versus buying food to free up time for home
chores and management.
Furthermore, results show that the larger the
household size the lower the household food
purchases, in both high- and low-food-budget
countries. This is presumably because having
their own labour allows households to substitute
purchased food with their own production,
for example in processing and farming. This
is reinforced with the expected negative effect
on food purchases of ownership of farmland
and animal stocks.
There is a diffusion of processed foods
and food away from home across the
rural–urban continuum, but it is higher in
urban areas
In all regions, there has been diffusion of
purchased processed foods, as well as food away
from home (e.g. prepared food from vendors or
in restaurants), in urban and rural areas. Over
centuries, small- and large-scale processing of
staple foods (e.g. polished rice, wheat and maize
flour, edible oils) have introduced essential
time- and energy-saving innovations, presenting
opportunities for nutritional enhancement such as
food fortification. Food processing has continued
to grow, expanding to prepared foods, both at
small scale (often unpackaged and unbranded)
and at very large scale (packaged and branded).
While the diffusion of processed foods, including
highly processed foods, is already advanced in
Asia9 and Latin America,13 it is spreading quickly
in Africa as well.14
Increasing numbers of women are working
outside the home in both urban and rural
areas, while men and women are increasingly
commuting to work in urban areas and going
to off-farm jobs in rural areas. These factors
may prompt a rise in purchases of prepared
food from food service enterprises, due to
reduced time availability for home processing
(e.g. hand-pounding grains) and food preparation.
The dynamics of supply and demand for
processed foods, however, are complex. There has
been a surge on the supply side, with small and
medium enterprises and large private companies
alike making massive aggregate investments in
all types of processed foods (from minimally to
highly processed) in response to demand.14 At the
same time, aggressive marketing and relatively
low pricing – and even interference in policies
»
| 82 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
to curb consumption of highly processed foods
and sugar-sweetened beverages – are driving
up consumption.
There is a critical role for minimally and low
processed foods as part of a healthy diet; in
addition, they are a major and growing source of
employment across the rural–urban continuum
(see Chapter 3). On the other hand, there is
growing evidence of the role of highly processed
foods in the development of overweight,
obesity and related NCDs (see Chapter 3). Many
countries now seek to curb consumption through
targeted interventions (e.g. bans in schools) and
population-based policies (e.g. taxation and
front-of-pack labelling) (see Chapter 5). Recent
studies in Africa show that the expansion of
food supply chains in the processing sector
(processing, wholesale, transport and retail)
provides a major source of employment across the
rural–urban continuum, especially for women and
youth.12 Latest estimates indicate that 20 percent
of rural employment and 25 percent of urban
employment are in agrifood systems jobs such as
wholesale and processing.12 Unfortunately, few
of these studies provide sufficient disaggregation
of product portfolios to assess the balance of
potential benefits and harms to healthy diet goals.
Examining the household consumption of both
low processed and highly processed foods and
food away from home provides insights into
food demand across the rural–urban continuum.
The demand for processed foods of all types in
Africa is expected to continue to rise over the
next decades with urbanization, the continued
rise in rural non-farm employment and the
concomitant effects on cost savings of food
preparation and thus demand for convenience
foods. Increased commuting to work is also
raising the opportunity cost of time for both men
and women, with meals and snacks purchased
at roadside stalls, restaurants and market kiosks.
Evidence shows that this process has already been
seen in other developing regions.15, 16
In the analysis that follows, all food items
were classified by level of food processing
based on the four main groups in the NOVA
food classification system. Unprocessed and
minimally processed foods (group 1) were then
excluded from the analyses in this section.
Groups 2 and 3 were combined as one group,
referred to as “low processed”, and group 4 was
maintained as highly processed. See Annex 5 for
an explanation and full description and sources
of the processing categories applied. In addition
to these two categories, food away from home
was made a separate, single category, because
there is insufficient information to identify
the extent of processing for all items involved
and it is therefore not possible to accurately
categorize such food.
The diffusion of processed foods across the
continuum is similar and quite extensive for both
high- and low-food-budget countries (Figure 26A).
The exception to this is in areas less than 1 hour
from intermediate cities of low-food-budget
countries, where the share is much lower if
compared to the same catchment areas of
high-food-budget countries. On average, the share
of total processed foods and food away from
home is 29 percent in high-food-budget countries,
and 25 percent in low-food-budget countries.
Even households living in rural areas 1 to 2 hours
or more from a city or town are consuming
processed foods and food away from home.
While the consumption of processed foods and
food away from home is higher in cities and
towns, in terms of consumed value shares, it only
declines gradually moving into peri-urban areas;
however, there is a more abrupt drop in peri-urban
areas of intermediate cities in low-food-budget
countries (Figure 26A). Evidence of a smooth and
gradual diminishing share along the continuum
dispels the notion of a sharp rural–urban divide in
the consumption of processed foods.
Looking at low processed and highly processed
foods separately, we find that in both sets of
countries, highly processed foods account
for a small proportion of total consumption
(Figure 26B). However, the shares are slightly higher
in peri-urban areas of small cities and towns
and rural areas of low-food-budget countries
compared to the same areas in high-food-budget
countries. The shares of highly processed foods
are also found to be greater in urban areas
than in rural areas, in both sets of countries.
The results highlight the penetration of highly
processed foods into rural areas, even those
living 1 to 2 hours or more from a city or town. »

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Highly processed foods are primarily packaged
with extended shelf-life,17 which may enhance
their spread to more remote rural areas given
their storability.
In both sets of countries, the consumption
value shares of low processed foods are higher
compared to highly processed foods, but in
urban and peri-urban areas of low-food-budget
countries the difference is much greater. This is
not unlike the pattern seen in other countries
with initial higher penetration of low processed
rather than highly processed foods.14
However, there is a marked difference in the
food consumption shares (at market value)
of both low processed and highly processed
foods and food away from home between
high- and low-food-budget countries. To more
clearly see these differences, Figure 27 shows
the difference between the food value shares
of the two categories of processed foods and
food away from home comparing high- and
low-food-budget countries.
In low-food-budget countries, low processed
food consumption in urban and peri-urban
areas is higher than in high-food-budget
countries. Not as high – but still higher in
low-food-budget countries – is the share of
highly processed foods in all areas, except large
cities and their surroundings. This is surprising

foods and food away from home, comparing high-food-budget countries with low-food-budget countries across the rural–urban continuum (URCA). The
classification of food items by level of food processing was adapted from the NOVA food classification system. All surveys are for 2018/19, except Malawi
(2019/20). See Annex 5 for the full definition of variables. See Table 10 for the definition and list of high- and low-food-budget countries.

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
because, as highlighted earlier, it is expected
that highly processed foods would be greater in
high-food-budget countries. On the other hand,
food away from home is higher as a share of total
household food consumption in high-food-budget
countries (Figure 27). This could suggest that there
is more off-farm employment in rural areas of
high-food-budget countries. This makes sense
as food away from home is correlated with
working outside the home and commuting within
cities or from rural to urban areas or other rural
areas (see Chapter 3). Such employment patterns
emerge with development and urbanization, both
correlated with high-food-budget countries.
As was done for food purchases, an econometric
analysis was undertaken to look into the
determinants (i.e. location effect of each URCA,
household income, non-farm employment, etc.)
of the share of purchases of highly processed
foods as a value share of total household food
consumption. Table A7.2 in Annex 7 presents the
statistically significant results, of which the key
points are highlighted below.
Holding other factors constant, the effects of
location across the rural–urban continuum
corroborate the descriptive findings: the farther
from a large city, the smaller the share of
highly processed foods in total household food
consumption for high-food-budget countries,
except for more remote areas in low-food-budget
countries. The finding on the location effect is
similar to that observed for the United Republic
of Tanzania (not included in this analysis),
according to a study using detailed household
budget survey data with urban, peri-urban and
rural gradations.17 It is also similar to findings for
rural and urban areas in Bangladesh, Indonesia,
Nepal and Viet Nam.9
The pure effect of income is associated with a
higher share of highly processed foods in both
country food-budget groups, but with a greater
impact in low-food-budget countries (Table A7.2 in
Annex 7). This corroborates findings from other
recent studies in Africa, for example in Uganda
and the United Republic of Tanzania.17 In both
high- and low-food-budget countries, more
non-farm employment leads to a higher share of
highly processed foods in total household food
consumption. This finding is particularly true
for male non-farm employment, as the effect is
found to be statistically significant in 8 out of
the 11 countries analysed. The effect for female
non-farm employment is similar to that for male
non-farm employment in high-food-budget
countries, but is not statistically significant in
low-food-budget countries.
All other things equal, the primary schooling of
the household head is significantly correlated
with a greater consumption value share of highly
processed foods in only three countries, while the
household head being female is correlated with a
greater share in most high-food-budget countries,
except for a dampening effect in Ethiopia (Table A7.2
in Annex 7). In the former, this is supported by
other studies showing that women substitute
processed foods for meal preparation to free up
time for other household chores, as well as off-farm
work.14 But in poorer countries, it could be that
women managing the household alone have less
time (and therefore less access) to buy these foods.
However, these results require further exploration.
Finally, larger households have a lower share of
highly processed food purchases in some of the
high-food-budget countries, whereas the effect is
mixed in low-food-budget countries (Table A7.2 in
Annex 7). The higher the dependency ratioy
 in both
country food-budget groups, the higher the share
of highly processed foods purchased.
Household food consumption by various
food groups varies over the rural–urban
continuum, driven by patterns of
urbanization, income and non-farm
employment
Urbanization is implicitly associated with shifts
in household food consumption, in which urban
households purchase a more varied diet, one that
is less dominated by staple foods and comprises
a larger variety of foods from other food groups,
including more expensive foods such as meat
and dairy (see Chapter 3). However, some studies
suggest that it is higher income in urban areas,
rather than urbanization per se, that is causing
these shifts.18 This section provides further
analysis of these issues.
y Dependency ratio takes into account the consumption needs of
young and elderly people, and the productivity of middle-aged people.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
All food items are categorized into eight food
groups: i) staple foods including cereals, roots,
tubers, plantains and their products; ii) pulses,
seeds, nuts and their products; iii) animal source
foods including milk, eggs, meat, fish, shellfish,
insects/grubs and all their products; iv) vegetables
and their products; v) fruits and their products; vi)
fats and oils; vii) sweets, condiments and beverages;
and viii) meals eaten outside the home (food away
from home). See Table A5.6 in Annex 5 for definitions
of food group aggregates. Given the number of food
groups to be analysed, the ten URCA categories are
further aggregated into three categories – urban,
peri-urban and rural – to facilitate the presentation
of some figures (see Table 9).
Looking at household food composition in terms
of the value shares of food consumption by food
group, a diet transition is clearly occurring across
the rural–urban continuum (Table 11). This involves
a diversification of diets at the household level,
including the consumption of more expensive
food items, like animal source foods and fruits.
This suggests the transition is also occurring in
rural areas, though lagged and to a lesser extent
than in urban and peri-urban areas.
Interestingly, in this small group of countries in
Africa, there are no major differences between
high- and low-food-budget countries. This might
suggest a convergence in the diet transition
occurring across the set of countries. The finding
that consumption value shares of non-staple foods
are similar in the two food-budget groups is
somewhat paradoxical. This could be because in
both sets of countries, low-cost non-staple foods
– such as vegetables or pulses – are accessible
and also desired by households. Another study
in Senegal19 found that household expenditure
shares were similar in urban and rural areas, but
the absolute levels of expenditure were lower
in rural areas and among the poor. This may
be similar to saying that low-cost pulses figure
largely in the diets of the poor. The findings
do not negate Bennett’s law,z
 but make its
slope more gradual.
z In agricultural economics and development economics, Bennett’s
law observes that as incomes rise, people eat relatively fewer caloriedense starchy staple foods and relatively more nutrient-dense meats,
oils, sweeteners, fruits and vegetables.8
Staple foods as a share of household food
consumption in value terms are on average
30 percent (high-food-budget countries) and
28 percent (low-food-budget countries) in urban
areas (Figure 28). Note that this share is just slightly
above the share of 25 percent in Asian cities.9
Consumption value shares of staple foods,
including market-valued own-produced staple
foods, are similar in peri-urban and rural areas,
but roughly 12 percentage points higher than in
urban areas. The average share of staple foods
in total houseold food consumption is similar in
high- and low-food-budget countries: 41 percent
and 40 percent (respectively) in peri-urban areas,
and 42 percent and 43 percent (respectively)
in rural areas.
As expected, following Bennett’s law, as
household income rises the share of staple
foods in total household food consumption falls
(Figure 28). This holds true across the rural–urban
continuum, whether looking at urban, peri-urban
or rural aggregate categories (as shown in
Figure 28) or at more disaggregated URCA
categories (not shown).
Overall, the value shares of staple foods comprise
a minority of total household food consumption,
not only in urban areas but across the rural–urban
continuum. It is striking that the diversification
of household food consumption, which is the
inverse of dependence on staple foods, is similar
in urban areas of both country food-budget
groups. Furthermore, the ratio of the shares
of staple foods in rural areas to urban areas is
nearly the same in high- and low-food-budget
countries (1.4 and 1.5, respectively), suggesting an
intercountry convergence.
The smaller staple food shares in urban areas are
generally offset by larger shares of animal source
foods and food away from home (Figure 29A).
This is expected, as urbanization is generally
associated with urban households procuring
more varied foods, including more expensive
foods such as meat, but also eating outside the
home more often. With this analysis, however, as
previously mentioned, it is not possible to assess
the types of foods consumed away from home,
whether they contribute to diversity, and their
level of processing.

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
In urban areas, on average across the countries
analysed, animal source food consumption value
shares (which include milk, eggs, meat, fish,
shellfish and insects) are 40 percent higher than
in peri-urban areas and 44 percent higher than in
rural areas. Looking at low-food-budget countries,
the share in urban areas is 1.5 times higher than
in peri-urban areas and 1.6 times higher than in
rural areas. For high-food-budget countries, the
differences are smaller: urban shares are 1.4 times
higher than peri-urban and rural (not shown here,
see Figure A7.1A in Annex 7).
There is also a notable
decrease in value shares
of pulses, seeds and nuts
in urban areas compared
to peri-urban areas and
rural areas (40 percent
and 47 percent lower
than in peri-urban and rural areas, respectively)
(Figure 29A). This finding is typical, as these items
are cheaper sources of nutrient-rich foods, but
Animal source foods
and food away from home
increasingly substitute
staple foods, moving
from rural to urban areas
across the continuum

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
tend to be supplanted by animal source foods (if
only by milk in partially vegetarian countries
such as India) as people’s incomes increase.
Across all countries, shares of food away from
home are higher in urban areas, and decline
steeply moving to peri-urban and rural areas
(Figure 29). On average, shares are 1.6 times higher
in urban areas than in peri-urban areas, and
2.6 times higher than in rural areas. This pattern
is stronger in low-food-budget countries, with
urban shares 2.4 times higher than in peri-urban
areas, and 3.2 times higher than in rural areas
(see Figure A7.1B in Annex 7).
A more disaggregated look at the consumption
value shares by food group shows that on
average across all countries, there is no abrupt
rural–urban divide across the continuum
(Figure 29B). Again, this is a surprise, as it is
generally assumed there is a marked difference
between urban and rural areas. Moving across the
continuum from urban to rural areas (Figure 29B),
there is an increasing share of staple foods and
pulses, seeds and nuts, and a decreasing share of
animal source foods and food away from home.
In contrast, shares for vegetables, fruits, and fats
and oils are fairly uniform across the rural–urban
continuum. Although there are some variations,

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
sweets, condiments and beverages also are
uniform (see Table 11 for disaggregated values by
high- and low-food-budget countries).
An econometric analysis of the determinants of
consumption of the different food groups provides
further insights. For example, the determinants
of consumption of animal source foods and food
away from home corroborate the descriptive trends.
Increases in the share of consumption of animal
source foods in household food consumption are
mainly driven by statistically significant increases
in income (see Table A7.3 in Annex 7).
For the shares of food away from home, the
effect of income is mixed across high- and
low-food-budget countries, but it shows an
average higher consumption share as income
increases when all countries are pulled
together (Table A7.4 in Annex 7). However, in
both country food-budget groups, more male
non-farm employment leads to a higher share
of food away from home and the effect is
higher in high-food-budget countries than in
low-food-budget countries. This may reflect
employment that is more spatially dispersed, with
longer commutes, and thus a greater need for food
away from home. It may also be the case that in
some high-food-budget countries, restaurants and
vendors (i.e. food services) that prepare meals (for
food away from home) are more plentiful.
The location effect across the rural–urban
continuum is present and statistically significant
in low-food-budget countries. In this case, the
consumption value share of food away from
home is much greater in large cities than in
towns, but decreases incrementally in peri-urban
areas the larger the size of the closest city, and
decreases moving from towns to rural areas,
with the largest decrease occurring in areas 1
to 2 hours from any urban centre. The location
effect is statistically significant for fewer URCA
categories in high-food-budget countries. It shows
a greater consumption of food away from home in
large and intermediate cities compared to towns,
and a decrease in rural areas, with the largest
drop occurring in areas more than 2 hours from
any urban centre. These results corroborate the
descriptive findings: the larger the urban city,
the higher the share of food away from home
in total consumption; the greater the distance
from a large city, the smaller the share (Table A7.4
in Annex 7). The consumption of food away from
home is often linked to commuting for work;
therefore these patterns reflect how much farther
workers have to commute from home in cities
compared to rural areas.
In contrast to animal
source foods and food
away from home,
the analysis of the
determinants of the
share of vegetables in
total household food
consumption suggests
that this consumption
is driven more by
access and availability than by income. The effect
of income on vegetable consumption is mixed,
but overall negative and statistically significant,
indicating a reduction in vegetable consumption
shares as income increases (Table A7.5 in Annex 7).
On the other hand, considering all countries
together, there are statistically significant
location effects on the share of vegetables in
total household food consumption across the
rural–urban continuum – after controlling
for income. Large, intermediate and small
cities and areas less than 1 hour from large
and intermediate cities have higher shares of
vegetable consumption than do towns (Table A7.5 in
Annex 7). For low-food-budget countries, there is
also a notable decrease in the share of vegetable
consumption in rural areas. These findings
may reflect the presence of major horticultural
commercial zones near cities, or in well-watered
areas near highways and rivers, in both low- and
high-food-budget countries.
In both high- and low-food-budget countries,
the effect of non-farm employment is mostly
non-significant (Table A7.5 in Annex 7). However,
if the household is headed by a woman, there
is a positive effect on the share of vegetable
consumption in both country food-budget
groups. Since the effect of income is taken into
consideration at the same time, this can be
interpreted as an indication that female diet
choices for households make a difference, as
women, for example, choose food with greater
nutrient and vitamin content. n
For household consumption,
shares of animal source
foods are driven by income,
while shares of fruits and
vegetables are determined by
access and availability.

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
4.2
COST AND AFFORDABILITY
OF A HEALTHY DIET,
AND FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION ACROSS
THE RURAL–URBAN
CONTINUUM
KEY MESSAGES
è In the 11 African countries analysed, the cost of a
healthy diet in urban areas is much higher (on average
1.2 times higher) than in peri-urban areas, and it
then decreases the smaller the city size and moving
closer to rural areas. This trend is less pronounced in
high-food-budget countries, which show similar costs
across all urban areas.
è The higher cost of animal source foods, compared
to the other food groups, drives up the cost of a healthy
diet across the rural–urban continuum, especially in
urban areas and remote rural areas.
è The lower cost of a healthy diet in peri-urban areas
of the 11 countries analysed compared to urban areas
does not translate into more affordable healthy diets, as
income levels are a considerable factor. The percentage
of the population unable to afford a healthy diet in
peri-urban areas is higher than in urban areas and
similar to rural areas.
è In the 11 countries in Africa, the cost of a healthy
diet exceeds average food expenditure for lowand middle-income households in both high- and
low-food-budget countries. Low-income households
living in peri-urban and rural areas are especially
disadvantaged, as they would need to more than
double what they currently spend on food to secure a
healthy diet.
è In many of these African countries studied, the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in
urban and peri-urban areas is similar to that in rural
areas, and in some cases, slightly higher, indicating that
food insecurity is not exclusively a rural problem in most
of the countries analysed.
è In the three countries analysed in Africa, the
prevalence of child stunting generally increases
as cities become smaller and as one moves away
from urban centres. Child wasting and overweight
are lower and exhibit less evident trends across
the rural–urban continuum.
Based on the latest estimates (Chapter 2), we are
not on track to end all forms of malnutrition by
2030. For instance, still 148.1 million children
under five years of age were stunted in 2022,
while 45 million were wasted and 37 million
were overweight. According to the Global
Burden of Disease Study, in 2019 dietary risk
was the second largest Level 2 risk factoraa for
attributable deaths among females and the
third among males.20
All forms of malnutrition have multiple
causes, but healthy diets can help reduce the
risk of malnutrition in all its forms, including
micronutrient deficiency, stunting, wasting,
overweight and obesity, as well as diet-related
NCDs.21 The determinants of consumption
of healthy diets are similarly highly complex
and include behavioural and cultural factors,
food placement and promotion within the food
environment. It is clear, however, that to ensure
access to healthy diets, nutritious foods must
be both available and affordable. Availability
refers to the existence of food coming from
either own production or the market, while
affordability refers to people’s financial capacity
to acquire sufficient food, which in turn depends
on household income and food prices. Low
incomes constrain how much food households
can economically access, but relative prices
and systematic food price dispersionab will
greatly influence the types of foods selected
and, as a result, may influence diet-related
nutrition outcomes.22
aa The Global Burden of Disease Study20 estimates the prevalence of
exposure and attributable deaths for, among others, 23 age groups;
males, females, and both sexes combined; and 204 countries and
territories. The study uses a risk factor hierarchy of 87 risks or clusters
of risks. Level 1 risk factors are behavioural, environmental and
occupational, and metabolic; Level 2 comprises 20 risk factors or
clusters of risks; Level 3 comprises 52 risk factors or clusters of risks;
and Level 4 comprises 69 specific risk factors.
ab Food price dispersion emerges when the same kind of foods are
sold at different prices by stores in the same market.
| 92 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
It is worth recalling that the affordability
indicator is a measure of economic access. It
measures not the number of people not eating a
healthy diet, but rather the number who do not
have enough resources to acquire a healthy diet.
As such, the contribution of social protection
programmes such as school feeding programmes
are not taken into consideration. On the other
hand, social programmes such as cash-based
transfers, whether in-kind or monetary, or food
donation programmes, are considered part of the
household income.
The 2020 edition of this report showed the
existence of within-country variations in the
cost and affordability of a healthy diet, but it
did not cover variations across the rural–urban
continuum. Studies suggest that urbanization
may directly exert upward pressure on food
prices in poor countries.18 This is because most
households now depend on food supplied by
markets rather than their own production.
This is particularly true in urban areas where
– as shown in Figure 24 in Section 4.1 – food
purchases constitute more than 78 percent of
household consumption in the 11 sub-Saharan
African countries analysed. However, it also
holds true in peri-urban and rural areas,
where households of almost all countries
analysed acquire more than 50 percent of the
food consumed in markets. Such high shares
increase the risk of food hoarding when prices
are expected to rise, which itself can contribute
to higher prices.
This section presents a new descriptive analysis
of indicators of healthy diet access, food security
and nutrition for selected countries. The analysis
relies on the geospatial URCA dataset (see Box 2
and Box 3 in Chapter 3, and Annex 4, Section A);
while there is no comparable global dataset to
support the analysis, there are microlevel national
survey data that, once merged with the URCA
dataset, could provide insights on differences
across the rural–urban continuum. The analysis
focuses on the 11 sub-Saharan countries covered
in Section 4.1, using the same household survey
data (see Table A5.1 in Annex 5), and still grouping
them into high-food-budget countries (2.3 PPP
dollars per capita per day) and low-food-budget
countries (1.6 PPP dollars per capita per day)
(see Table 10 for the list of countries by category).
Similar to Section 4.1, patterns, differences and
similarities are also analysed across ten URCA
categories of the rural–urban continuum, as well
as a further aggregation into urban, peri-urban
and rural categories (see Table 9 and Annex 5,
Section B for further details).
Cost and affordability of a healthy diet
across the rural–urban continuum
The calculation of subnational cost and
affordability of a healthy diet follows the same
methodology as the global monitoring CoAHD
indicators presented in Chapter 2. However,
national estimates derived from the aggregation
of subnational indicators are not comparable
with global CoAHD indicators due to differences
in data sources. For further information and
the full description of the data sources and
methodology, see Annex 8.
Cost of a healthy diet
Across the 11 African countries analysed, the cost
of a healthy diet in urban centres is much higher
(on average 1.2 times higher) than in peri-urban
areas and it then decreases the smaller the city
size and moving closer to rural areas. The higher
cost of a healthy diet in urban centres in almost
all countries analysed may be associated with the
widespread diffusion of supermarkets in cities.
While diffusion of supermarkets may increase
access to a more diverse diet (see Chapter 3),
it may also push the cost of a healthy diet up,
making it less affordable for poorer households
in urban centres.
However, there are exceptions to this cost
pattern. For example, in Guinea-Bissau, the
cost in peri-urban areas is slightly higher than
in urban areas. This is likely attributed to the
unique geographic concentration of cities in
the south around the port of Bissau and to poor
infrastructure, particularly in ferry and road
transport systems linking urban and peri-urban
areas that are 1 hour away or less (Figure A6.1D
in Annex 6).23 In Ethiopia and Togo, the other
exceptions, the cost is higher in rural areas
than in peri-urban areas; this is directly related
to the dispersed urbanization pattern in these
countries (see Figure A6.1C in Annex 6), with poor
rural areas inadequately connected to urban areas
due to poor and limited road infrastructure.24
| 93 |
CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
Generally, in these three exceptional cases,
poor transport infrastructure is a major factor
hampering availability of nutritious foods (often
highly perishable) and pushing up their cost
in rural areas.
Average values across countries also hide
differences between high- and low-food-budget
countries as shown in Figure 30A. The cost of a
healthy diet in high-food-budget countries is
23 percent – 22 percent and 28 percent higher
than in low-food-budget countries, comparing
urban, peri-urban and rural areas. The higher
cost in high-food-budget countries is mainly
due to the higher cost of vegetables and animal
source foods (29 percent and 32 percent higher
than in low-food-budget countries, respectively).
For both country food-budget groups, the largest
decrease in the cost occurs moving from urban to
peri-urban areas, while in rural areas the cost is
similar to (in high-food-budget countries) or only
slightly lower than (in low-food-budget countries)
that in peri-urban areas.
A more disaggregated view of the rural–urban
continuum (i.e. considering the ten URCA
categories) reveals a much closer convergence
in the cost of a healthy diet in high-food-budget
countries, particularly in urban areas (Figure 30B).
On the other hand, the range in the cost is wider
for low-food-budget countries. The greater
convergence in the cost of a healthy diet in
high-food-budget countries points to their
better connectivity in food supply chains
across the rural–urban continuum compared to
low-food-budget countries.
Looking at the cost pattern across the rural–urban
continuum for individual countries also provides
further insights (Table A9.2 in Annex 9). For example,
in Benin and Togo, households living in urban
centres face a cost, respectively, 1.4 and 1.7 times
higher than households living in peri-urban areas
– and most of the population of these countries is
concentrated in peri-urban areas of small cities.
This suggests that a more dispersed urbanization
pattern, likely involving decentralized markets
served by local producers, may significantly drive
the cost of healthy diets down.
Finally, and differently from that seen for
low-food-budget countries, the cost of a healthy
diet basket is particularly high in very remote
rural areas, more than 2 hours from any urban
centre in high-food-budget countries (Table A9.2 in
Annex 9). Among the high-food budget countries,
the cost difference between these remote areas
and rural areas 1 to 2 hours from any urban centre
is particularly high in Nigeria. This may be a
reflection of the different urbanization patterns
in those countries, which have undergone a
metropolitan expansion process with most of the
population living in large and/or intermediate cities
and in peri-urban areas 1 hour away or less. In
this situation, a more abrupt separation from more
remote rural areas can be expected, with disruption
in the food supply chain and higher prices.
The cost structure by food group of a healthy
diet does not present any striking differences
across URCAs, with each of the six food groups
contributing to the total cost of a healthy diet
in about the same percentage, independently
of the catchment area for both high- and
low-food-budget countries (Figure A9.1 in Annex 9).
The largest cost contribution by food group
to a healthy diet comes from animal source
foods (31–41 percent), followed by vegetables
(17–22 percent), staple foods (16–21 percent), fruits
(10–18 percent), fats and oils (6–8 percent), and
pulses, seeds and nuts (6–8 percent).
However, it is worth noting the higher cost share
of animal source foods in all urban centres and
peri-urban areas of high-food-budget countries,
compared to low-food-budget countries (between
2 and 6 percentage points difference) (Figure A9.1
in Annex 9). The largest cost difference is found
in towns, where households in high-food-budget
countries spend USD 0.29 more per person per
day on animal source foods than do households
in low-food-budget countries (Figure 31).
The other trend to highlight is the higher cost
contribution of animal source foods compared to
all other food groups, even vegetables and fruits
combined, in almost all URCAs in both country
food-budget groups. The main outliers are large
cities of low-food-budget countries, due to the
higher share of fruits in the cost of a healthy diet
(Figure A9.1 in Annex 9).
Finally, the cost contribution of animal source
foods in the total cost of a healthy diet (both as »

share and in terms of money value) is also high in
more remote areas (more than 2 hours travel to a
city or town) in both high- and low-food-budget
countries. On the other hand, it is lower in
peri-urban areas of intermediate and small cities,
as well as in areas 1 to 2 hours from a city of any
size (Figure 31 and Figure A9.1 in Annex 9).
The lower cost of animal source foods in
peri-urban areas, coupled with the high cost of
fruits and vegetables in large cities, particularly in
low-food-budget countries, explains the decrease
in the overall cost of a healthy diet basket from
urban to rural areas across the continuum
(Figure 31). The lower cost of fruits, vegetables and
animal source foods in the outskirts of cities is
clearly a consequence of the proximity to the
production site of these perishable products. In
fact, the increasing demand for animal source
foods from better-off urban dwellers is attracting
more medium- and large-scale livestock operators
to urban and peri-urban areas (such operators
had moved farther away when urbanization first
began to intensify).25 Furthermore, the wider
cost difference for animal source foods across
the rural–urban continuum of low-food-budget
countries is likely due to the higher constraints in
the cold supply chain.
Cost of a healthy diet compared to actual household
food expenditure
The food demand analysis in Section 4.1
shows the patterns of food consumption across
the rural–urban continuum, including the
market value of the foods consumed by food
group. From this analysis, however, it is not
possible to determine whether the consumed
diet provides the quantity of calories and
nutrients, and the diverse intake of foods from
different food groups that would constitute a
healthy diet. This would require a different set
of data and information, which is not available.
On the other hand, it is possible to compare
the cost of a healthy diet to what households
are actually spending on food (including
market value of own food production), in
order to determine whether they would have
to spend more or less of the income they have
available to secure a healthy diet. This is a
useful comparison, especially as estimates
can be disaggregated by URCA category and
household income level.
On average at the national level, the cost of a
healthy diet is lower than the amount households
spend on food in the high-food-budget
countries analysed (see Table A9.1 in Annex 9). For
high-food-budget countries, the cost of a healthy
diet is 86 percent of average food consumption,
varying from 74 percent to 97 percent among
the countries in this group. For low-food-budget
countries, there is more variability. In two
countries (Burkina Faso and the Niger), the cost
of a healthy diet is almost 40 percent greater
than average food consumption. However, in the
others, the cost of a healthy diet is lower than the
actual amount spent on food.
The national averages, however, obscure the fact
that for low- and middle-income households in
both country food-budget groups, the cost of a
healthy diet actually exceeds average expenditure
on food (Figure 32A). For low-income households,
the cost of a healthy diet basket is about twice
the amount that households spend on food:
specifically, 2.3 times higher in low-food-budget
countries and 2 times higher in high-food-budget
countries. Middle-income households would
also need to increase current spending to have
access to a healthy diet (i.e. by 34 percent in
low-food-budget countries and 17 percent in
high-food-budget countries).
This problem is seen for all low- and
middle-income households in both high- and
low-food-budget countries across the rural–urban
continuum, although it becomes particularly acute
moving from urban to peri-urban areas (Figure 32B).
Low-income households living in peri-urban
and rural areas are especially disadvantaged, as
they would need to more than double what they
currently spend on food to secure a healthy diet.
Affordability of a healthy diet across the
rural–urban continuum
Affordability, or the cost of a healthy diet
relative to income that households can credibly
reserve for food, reflects the ability to access a
healthy diet. Tracing this affordability across
each URCA in the 11 countries analysed shows
how economic access to a healthy diet follows
different paths in countries with different
levels of development and urbanization.
Importantly, high costs do not necessarily
translate into greater unaffordability, and vice

versa, as this depends on the level of income
relative to the cost.
Indeed, this is a key finding from the analysis.
Although the cost of a healthy diet in peri-urban
areas is lower than in urban areas (Figure 30A), this
does not translate into a more affordable healthy
diet in the former (Figure 33). On average, the
percentage of the population unable to afford a
healthy diet in peri-urban areas is 1.5 times higher
than in urban centres and similar to rural areas.
In the Niger, a low-food-budget country with
the highest percentage of population living in
areas more than 1 hour from any urban centre
among the 11 countries analysed, the percentage
of population unable to afford a healthy diet
grows as cities get smaller and as one moves
into rural areas. In this case, there is an increase
of 52 percentage points between large cities
and towns (Figure 33 and Table A9.3 in Annex 9).

pattern similar to that of high-food-budget
countries, with affordability levels within
each country remaining more or less constant
across urban centres.
In low-food-budget countries (except Benin
and Togo), moving away from urban centres
introduces a structural change, with the
percentage of population unable to access
a healthy diet increasing significantly. In
high-food-budget countries (except Ethiopia),
this jump occurs one step farther along the
continuum, crossing peri-urban areas of large and
intermediate cities. Finally, in high-food-budget
countries, the percentage of the population
unable to afford a healthy diet increases across
peri-urban areas as the size of the closest urban
centre decreases (Figure 33).
Food insecurity across the rural–urban
continuum
The comparison of food insecurity among
rural, peri-urban and urban populations at the
global and regional levels based on the Degree
of Urbanization (DEGURBA) classification,ac
presented in Chapter 2, indicates that food
insecurity is lower in urban areas at the global
level. At the regional level, Africa and Latin
America and the Caribbean follow this pattern,
but not Asia nor Northern America and Europe,
revealing context-specific differences that defy
generalization. An analysis of patterns of the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale
(FIES), using household survey data for 9 of the
11 countries studied up until now, grouped by
food budget (see Table 10) and according to the
URCA-defined rural–urban continuum (see Table 9),
sheds light on some context-specific differences
and has the potential to complement the
analysis in Chapter 2.
In many of the analysed countries, the prevalence
of moderate or severe food insecurity in urban
and peri-urban areas is similar to that in rural
areas (e.g. Côte d’Ivoire, Senegal) or sometimes
ac The DEGURBA classification was developed by EUROSTAT, ILO,
FAO, OECD, UN-Habitat and the World Bank and was approved at the
51st session of the UN Statistical Commission in March 2020.26 This
differs from the Urban Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) criteria used for
the analysis of subsets of countries in this section (see Box 3).
even slightly higher (e.g. Niger, Nigeria)
(Figure 34). This suggests that food insecurity is
not exclusively a rural problem in most of the
countries analysed.
The FIES analysis shows a different pattern
across the rural–urban continuum in highand low-food-budget countries. In general,
low-food-budget countries show larger differences
and varying patterns in food insecurity (Figure 34A).
In Malawi, moderate or severe food insecurity
is much lower in urban areas and increases
significantly moving to peri-urban and rural
areas, with extremely high levels of severe food
insecurity in both areas. Moderate or severe food
insecurity in urban and peri-urban areas is about
the same in Benin, but in Burkina Faso it is higher
in urban areas than in peri-urban areas. Only
in Guinea-Bissau and Togo is there a gradual
increase moving from urban to rural areas.
In contrast, in high-food-budget countries, the
prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity
is about the same across the rural–urban
continuum (Figure 34A). In the case of Nigeria, there
is some indication that moderate or severe food
insecurity may be highest in peri-urban areas and
lowest in rural areas (Figure 34A).
Further disaggregation reveals some additional
differences. However, the sample sizes in each
category are small and the margins of error
are very large, so the observed patterns must
be interpreted with caution (see the full set of
results in Table A10.1 and Table A10.2 in Annex 10).
For example, in Nigeria, a high-food-budget
country, the prevalence of food insecurity is
positively associated with city size: the bigger
the city, the higher the prevalence of food
insecurity (Figure 34B). Moreover, levels of severe
food insecurity in large and intermediate
cities (15 percent and 14 percent, respectively)
are even higher than in more remote areas
(10 percent in areas more than 2 hours travel
to any urban centre). This is likely related to
the presence of slums outside the larger cities.
A similar pattern is also observed in Burkina
Faso, a low-food-budget country with a more
dispersed urbanization pattern.
In the Niger, the pattern is reversed: the
prevalence of moderate or severe food »

CHAPTER 4 THE INTERPLAY OF FOOD SUPPLY AND DEMAND AND THE COST AND AFFORDABILITY <...>
insecurity increases as the size of the city
decreases (Figure 34B) – similar to the pattern
found for the percentage of the population
unable to afford a healthy diet basket in those
countries – but then begins to fall moving into
peri-urban areas, with the exception of a sharp
uptick in areas less than 1 hour from a town.
Malawi, on the other hand, presents evidence
of a structural change: a sudden worsening
of food insecurity, most notably severe food
insecurity, for households living in areas less
than 1 hour travel to an intermediate city, with
high levels of food insecurity moving to remote
rural areas more than 2 hours travel to any city
or town (Figure 34B).
Another analysis of food insecurity based
on FIES from 21 rural development projects
worldwide, looking at the ten URCA categories
of the rural–urban continuum, is presented
in Box 6. While this analysis is not nationally
representative, it provides some perspective
beyond the nine African countries analysed
above, even if at project level.
In summary, the results of the analysis of
nationally representative FIES datasets from
the nine African countries, as well as of the
FIES data collected in the context of these rural
development projects, tend to indicate that food
insecurity is not exclusively a rural problem in
many places. While it is not possible to draw
general conclusions given the limited number
of countries in this chapter’s FIES analysis (all
from one region), the results – including those
from the 21 rural development projects – signal
that further research is needed to guide more
targeted policies and investments across the
rural–urban continuum.
Nutritional status across the rural–urban
continuum
The prevalence of malnutrition across the
ten URCA categories was also estimated only
for 3 of the 11 countries of the sections above
(i.e. Benin, Nigeria and Senegal),ad due to data
limitations. The analysis is based on 2018
data from demographic and health surveys
(Table A5.1). See Table A10.3 in Annex 10 for the full
table of results.
In the three countries, generally the prevalence
of stunting in children under five years of age
gradually increases as cities become smaller
and as one moves away from urban centres.
The biggest increase in Nigeria occurs moving
to areas less than 1 hour travel to a small city,
while in Benin it is seen moving into more
remote rural areas (i.e. more than 2 hours
travel to an urban centre). The prevalence
of stunting is notably lower in Senegal, and
while there is a general pattern of increases,
with some variations as one moves away from
urban areas, the increases are smaller with
some variations (e.g. there is a notable decrease
in areas less than 1 hour travel to large and
intermediate cities, as well as to a town).
Furthermore, as already emerged in the
analysis of the cost and affordability of a
healthy diet across URCAs, the data suggest
that the size of the closest urban centre plays a
role in the prevalence of stunting in peri-urban
areas, with the prevalence being higher in
areas closest to small cities and towns in
Benin and Nigeria. This result is aligned with
other studies that find high levels of food
insecurity and malnutrition in the sprawling
poverty-stricken areas surrounding many cities
in Africa. Food access is limited, and many of
these peri-urban slums are food deserts, where
residents’ access to diverse, fresh or nutritious
foods is limited or even non-existent due to
the absence or low density of food entry points
(see Box 4 in Chapter 3) and inadequate access to
services, including health and education.
ad The choice of the three countries was data driven in Benin and
Nigeria, as they are the only countries among the 11 for which
georeferenced data on malnutrition for 2018/19 exist.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023 BOX 6 FOOD SECURITY ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM: EVIDENCE FROM 21 RURAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WORLDWIDE
Between 2019 and 2021, household-level
data with GPS coordinates were collected from
21 rural development projects supported by IFAD
and implemented in most regions of the world.
This includes five countries in Asia and the Pacific;
six in Eastern and Southern Africa; four in Latin
America and the Caribbean; four in Near East,
Northern Africa, Europe and Central Asia; and
three in Western and Central Africa (see Annex 5,
Section D for the full list of countries and projects).
These datasets contain information from more
than 41 000 households and are representative
of small-scale producers who are engaged in
projects financed by international financial
organizations. The data were merged with the Urban
Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) dataset (using
GPS coordinates), and households were thereby
classified across the ten URCA categories of the
rural–urban continuum.
Figure A shows the prevalence of moderate or
severe food insecurity across the rural–urban
continuum using the pooled sample of the 21 rural
development projects. It is important to clarify that
for some URCA categories, the sample size is too
small to draw any statistically significant inference,
thus the results are presented and interpreted in
terms of a description of food insecurity across the
rural–urban continuum.
Results show that the prevalence of food
insecurity varies across the rural–urban continuum.
There is a higher prevalence of moderate or severe
food insecurity in areas close to towns (less than
1 hour travel) compared to areas more than 1 hour
from a city or town. In addition, there is a much
higher prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity in larger cities compared to smaller cities
or towns, and it is even higher than those living 1 to
2 hours or more than 2 hours from a city or town.
This bears some similarity to findings shown in
Figure 34B. On the other hand, severe food insecurity
is highest in rural areas that are less than 1 hour
to a town and more than 2 hours to a city or town.
However, of surprise is that severe food insecurity
is also very high in large cities, as well as high in
peri-urban areas of large and intermediate cities.
This analysis adds information on food insecurity
patterns that could be more specifically addressed
and targeted, but which are generally not visible
when looking at only the three urban, peri-urban and
rural categories.
In summary, the prevalence of moderate or
severe food insecurity among a selected number of
small-scale producers in urban and peri-urban areas
is high – in some cases as high or even higher than in
rural areas. This is similar to the findings for many of
the nine African countries analysed (Figure 34).

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
The prevalence of wasting in children under five
years of age is lower than that of stunting in all
three countries and exhibits less evident trends
across the rural–urban continuum (Figure 35B).
Nevertheless, there are hints of increased
wasting in some peri-urban and rural areas in
Nigeria and Senegal. Similarly, the prevalence
of overweight in children is low in all countries
and does not present a clear trend across the
rural–urban continuum (Figure 35C). However, it
is worth noting there is a suggestion towards
lower overweight in peri-urban areas and higher
overweight in some rural areas compared
to urban areas. n

CHAPTER 5
POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO
LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS
TRANSFORMATION FOR
HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS THE
RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
 KEY MESSAGES
è Actions, policies, new technologies, and
consequently needed investments to overcome
the challenges and seize the opportunities that
urbanization creates require a clear understanding
of the interaction between agrifood systems and the
rural–urban continuum.
è The policy approach needs to leverage the
progressive connectivity between urban, peri-urban
and rural areas through investments in infrastructure,
public goods and enhanced capacities, in order
to increase access to affordable healthy diets and
achieve food security and nutrition for everyone
across the continuum.
è In the face of a gradual convergence in dietary
patterns across the rural–urban continuum, including
the consumption of highly processed foods, policies
and legislation are needed to promote healthy food
environments, both formal and informal, and to
empower consumers to make nutritious food choices.
è In intermediate and small cities and towns
and their peri-urban and rural surroundings,
the midstream activities of agrifood systems
(i.e. logistics, processing and wholesale) can play an
essential role in economic development, reducing
the cost of nutritious foods and improving income
opportunities. This is particularly the case for
new investments that enable small and medium
enterprises to expand.
è The rural–urban continuum lens is critical to
determine what and where support is most needed
to address the insufficient worldwide availability of
and access to nutritious foods, particularly fruits and
vegetables. Improved access to production inputs and
irrigation infrastructure are needed across the whole
rural–urban continuum, but support should target
especially smallholder farmers in rural areas and
urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA) elsewhere.
è Public investment in research and development
needs to be increased to develop technologies and
innovations to create healthier food environments and
increase the availability and affordability of nutritious
foods. Technology can be particularly important to
boost the capacity of UPA to supply nutritious foods in
cities and towns.
è To strengthen rural–urban continuum connectivity
and linkages, agrifood systems governance
mechanisms and institutions need to cross sectoral
and administrative boundaries. Subnational and local
governments must play a key role in designing and
implementing policies beyond their administrative
authority, engaging with agrifood systems
stakeholders at all levels.
è Evidence from multilevel and multisector
governance mechanisms implementing school
feeding, UPA and/or public procurement suggests
these are potential entry points for making healthy
diets available and accessible.
Patterns of urbanization, as well as the size
and clustering of urban agglomerations and
the surrounding rural areas, are transforming
agrifood systems with implications for access to
affordable healthy diets, as well as food security
and nutrition (Chapter 3). The increased links
across the rural–urban continuum, coupled with
closer interactions between the components
of agrifood systems, create a number of
| 107 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
hinterland through a dense set of agrifood
systems links. Those links can be leveraged
to promote a place-based agrifood systems
transformation for improved access to affordable
healthy diets across the rural–urban continuum
leading to win–win situations.af For instance,
increased off-farm income opportunities in
peri-urban and rural areas in midstream and
downstream activities could increase economic
access to healthy diets, while improved
efficiency in the connectivity between producers
in rural areas, midstream activities in peri-urban
and urban areas, and consumers could reduce
the cost of nutritious foods.ag
The policy approach should take into
consideration the development and adoption
of technologies and innovations as essential
elements for transforming agrifood systems
inclusively and sustainably towards improved
access to affordable healthy diets.7, 8 Reinforcing
the science–policy interface is fundamental
to leverage transformative opportunities,8
and can be an essential complement for many
policies, investments and legislations oriented
to shift dietary preferences towards healthy
diets, improve the efficiency of midstream
activities and increase the supply of nutritious
foods. Given the multiple entry points created
by urbanization, however, there will be no
“one-size-fits-all” technological or innovative
solutions to address all the challenges and
take advantage of the opportunities for current
agrifood systems.
Finally, a policy approach which considers
the territory is inherently intersectoral and
involves different agrifood systems stakeholders:
public, private and civil society. The success
of this territory-oriented policy approach
rests therefore on the coordination of several
actors and stakeholders. Strong institutions
and governance mechanisms are required to
coherently implement policies, investments and
legislation on one side, and leverage technology
and innovation on the other, but they have to be
af This approach is also called “agroterritorial development” and is
analysed in detail in the 2017 edition of The State of Food and
Agriculture in the World.

ag As indicated in the 2020 edition of this report,6 inadequate food
logistics and poor public infrastructure, especially for perishable foods,
are key drivers of the cost of nutritious foods.
opportunities and challenges for the availability
and affordability of healthy diets. This chapter
argues that such interactions also create a
number of policy and programme entry points to
support agrifood systems transformation towards
affordable healthy diets. However, a change of
direction in policy is needed which considers
both agrifood systems and spatial dynamics,
and their interactions and interconnectedness.
A systems approach is therefore better suited for
effective solutions.1
Such an approach should also consider the
increasing convergence in food demand and
supply patterns across the rural–urban continuum
(Chapter 4). The growing importance of food
purchases, and of processed foods in dietary
patterns, opens up the opportunity for leveraging
midstream and downstream agrifood systems
activities which link primary production to the
final consumer. At the same time, the strong
growth of small and intermediate cities and
towns (SICTs), which, as shown in Figure 19B of
Chapter 3, comprise almost one-third of the global
population, needs to be considered in policy and
planning. Scholars have called them the “hidden”
and the “missing” middle, respectively.ae
Therefore, policies, investments and legislation
supporting the “hidden/missing middle” can
leverage the increased interconnectedness
driven by urbanization to facilitate the creation
of scale economies for smallholder farmers and
agrifood small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
increase off-farm employment opportunities and
rural household incomes, and reduce the cost
of healthy diets.
The interaction between agrifood systems
and the rural–urban continuum introduces
the notion of a “territory” as a unit of analysis
and policymaking for agrifood systems
transformation towards improving food
security and nutrition.4 A territory in this
context includes one or more urban areas which
are connected to each other and to the rural
ae The “hidden middle” is attributed to Reardon (2015)2 and refers to
the agrifood component between primary producers and final
consumers. It includes the “midstream” and “downstream” segments as
defined in Chapter 3 of this report. The “missing middle” is attributed to
Christiaensen and Todo (2014)3 and refers to small- and medium-sized
cities. In both cases, the terms have been used to indicate that policies
often miss the particularities and dynamism of the two “middles”.

oriented to enhance agrifood systems linkages
through the growing rural–urban connectivity.
In particular, subnational governments and
local governance mechanisms are key factors
for improving linkages across the rural–urban
continuum.9 Figure 36 provides a visual summary
of this approach to address the challenges and
leverage the opportunities that urbanization
creates in agrifood systems for ensuring
access to affordable healthy diets across the
rural–urban continuum.
This chapter first analyses different policy
alternatives available among the components
of agrifood systems, through a rural–urban
continuum lens, to address the challenges
and leverage the opportunities for access
to affordable healthy diets identified in the
previous chapters. As such, this chapter
focuses on policies to promote healthy food
environments; policies and investments
to leverage the economic potential of the
midstream of agrifood systems in SICTs,
which can lead to reduced cost and improved
affordability of healthy diets; and food
production policies to increase the supply of
nutritious foods. It then identifies technological
and innovative solutions across the different
agrifood systems components that show
potential to support agrifood systems
transformation towards affordable healthy
diets, noting those that can particularly work.
Finally, the chapter examines governance
mechanisms deemed most appropriate to
manage the proposed policy approach across
administrative and sectoral boundaries, and
highlights the role of subnational governments
and local administrations in designing and
implementing such mechanisms. n

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
5.1
POLICIES AND
INVESTMENTS FOR
HEALTHY DIETS ACROSS
THE RURAL–URBAN
CONTINUUM
Food environments and consumer
behaviour policies
Households obtain foods through various
sources, for example through own production,
purchases or gifts. As has been noted previously,
the majority of households across the rural–urban
continuum acquire foods through purchases. In
addition, processed foods are an important part
of households’ food consumption, not only in big
cities but also in small towns and rural areas.
Certain aspects of retail food environmentsah are
becoming more similar across the rural–urban
continuum, for example, the presence of
food outlets and their role in making highly
processed foods more available. However,
there are also differences in the level of
formality of food outlets (e.g. supermarkets
or smaller food shops). Large and formal
outlets are more common in urban settings
and their surroundings, and less so in rural
areas far from cities where informal vendors
or “traditional” outlets (i.e. open-air or wet
markets) are more prevalent.11, 12 Yet these
informal vendors still play an important role
in retail food environments even in large or
intermediate cities, particularly in low-income
neighbourhoods and slums.13 Influencing
food environments through supportive
nutrition policies is an important entry point
to facilitate better access to safe, affordable and
nutritious foods and reduce consumption of
highly processed foods of high energy density
and minimal nutritional value. For this, an
understanding of the specificities of retail food
environments across the rural–urban continuum
will be key to identify common policies for
the entire continuum but also differentiated
ah Also called “built” food environments, they include informal and
formal markets where available food is chosen and purchased.10
policy entry points for key “nodes” across the
continuum (e.g. food environments in small
cities or towns versus food environments
in large cities).
Regulation of food and beverage marketing can
be important in a variety of settings across the
continuum.ai Advertising of highly processed
foods in rural settings is common and, depending
on the country, sometimes even more widely used
than in urban areas.11 Examples of local initiatives
to create healthier retail food environments
include restricting advertising of energy-dense
foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt in the
vicinity of schools15 in Mandurah (Australia), and
on public transport in London.16, 17
Taxation of energy-dense foods and beverages high
in fats, sugars and/or salt has been implemented
in 85 (for sugar-sweetened beverages) and
29 (for foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt)
countries18 and has shown clear evidence of
providing disincentives for buying these foods,19
contributing to shifting the demand towards more
nutritious foods.14 A recent systematic review in
six countries (Australia, Canada, Mexico, South
Africa, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, and United States of America)
found not only evidence of the impacts of such
taxation on reducing the sales of energy-dense
foods, but also that the health-related benefits
largely exceed the possible health costs of not
intervening.20 Taxation can also encourage
product reformulation to reduce the content of
the target component (e.g. sugars, salt, unhealthy
fats), thus improving its nutrient profile.
Nutrition labelling, by providing information on
the nutrition properties and the quality of foods
to aid purchase and consumption decisions,
has the potential to help rebalance a food retail
environment currently skewed towards foods
that undermine healthy diets.21 Marketing
influences children’s food preferences, purchase
requests and dietary intakes. Governments
have a legal obligation to protect child
rights, including those that are threatened by
harmful marketing.22
ai For more details regarding how these policies contribute to healthy
diets, please refer to the 2022 edition of this report.14

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Supporting healthier food outlets will be key for
enabling access to healthy diets, as this has shown
positive impacts on dietary quality.23 While
small neighbourhood food shops are important
for the food security of households, particularly
for low- to middle-income ones, consumers are
disproportionately exposed to energy-dense
highly processed foods in these shops.10 This
could be particularly important in rural areas,
where food is increasingly purchased in these
kinds of food outlets.11, 12 Policy incentives are
necessary to encourage shops to stock and sell
greater amounts of fresh and minimally processed
foods, for instance, by improving their cold
storage facilities.24 The availability of healthier
food outlets in particular areas across the
rural–urban continuum can be improved through
land-use planning and zoning regulations; tax
credits or exemptions; or licensing agreements.14
Although land-use planning tools are generally
underutilized to support healthy diets, a
combination of financial and zoning incentives
has been used at the city level to increase the
availability of healthy and affordable food options
in shops in under-served areas.25 Measures in
place to restrict outlets that predominantly sell
energy-dense foods high in fats, sugars and/or
salt include, for example, local authority zoning
measures that limit the establishment of hot food
takeaways or fastfood restaurants in or around
schools26, 27, 28, 29 or in particular neighbourhoods.30
In rural areas, where food sources include
purchased food and own production, some
policies could have positive effects not only
in shifting dietary patterns but also on the
availability and accessibility of healthy diets.
Nutrition education, while more common in
urban settings, has proven vital to encourage
more diverse and healthier dietary patterns at
the household level. Several studies have found
that in rural settings, nutrition education at home
or in schools could increase dietary diversity
in food consumption and, at the same time,
incentivize diversification of food production,
possibly improving the availability of nutritious
foods at the community level.31, 32
Considering that income is a main determinant
of the affordability of healthy diets, cash
transfers are also important for poor households
across the rural–urban continuum. In rural
areas, these can contribute to improve dietary
patterns and promote diversification of
food production through the alleviation of
liquidity constraints.33, 34 In addition, cash
transfer programmes associated with nutrition
education offer greater chances to improve child
nutrition and health.35
Turning to urban and peri-urban settings, street
food and food away from home businessesaj
play a particularly important role in both
employment provision and food security for the
most vulnerable populations. Street foods are
especially convenient for low-income workers
and households who may not have the resources,
facilities and/or time to prepare dishes at home.1
In some contexts, informal street vendors can
also be a key source of both nutritious foods and
livelihood; for example, in a peri-urban area of
Dar es Salaam where 70 percent of vegetables
were sold by informal vendors, often most of
these vendors were women (i.e. for 95 percent
of green leafy vegetables).36 However, street
food does not always contribute to healthy
diets among poor urban and peri-urban food
consumers.37 A critical aspect is to ensure the
safety and nutritional quality of street foods,
considering both the high degree of informality
of the street food sector and the fact that street
foods are consumed by an estimated 2.5 billion
people worldwide every day.38 Informal
street vendors play a major role in providing
food to the most vulnerable populations in
low-income countries (LICs) of Africa and
Asia, particularly in urban settings.1 There are
multiple infrastructure and regulatory gaps
along the street food supply chain and many
street vendors have temporary structures with
no running water or cold storage and sanitation
facilities. Important food safety actions include
ensuring a supply of water of acceptable quality
for food preparation, clean places for preparation
and consumption of food, sanitary facilities
for workers in food outlets, training for street
vendors and consumer education.38 Interventions
at national and local government levels are also
required to ensure nutritional quality for street
foods in each local situation (see Box 7).

premises. See the Annex 11 for a full definition of food away from home.

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
Finally, it is important to consider that gender
plays an important role in accessing affordable
healthy diets and, in turn, food security and
nutrition. Improving women’s status and gender
equality positively influence the nutritional
status of women and their families. Therefore,
eliminating structural gender inequalities
and unleashing women’s potential can play
a fundamental role in improving access to
affordable healthy diets. For instance, evidence
demonstrates that most transport systems are
biased towards the travel needs of men.39 In
Blantyre, Malawi, reduced transport options to
peri-urban and rural informal markets, which
are often more affordable than urban markets for
poor people, have reduced access to affordable
sources of food for female-headed households.40
This points to the need for multifaceted
and targeted territorial planning to address
gender-related challenges to access affordable
healthy diets. Efficient transport systems can
reduce the time between home and work, as can
strategically locating city food outlets that supply
nutritious, diverse food on the routes that women
take in their daily lives.39
Midstream food supply chain policies:
strengthening the role of the “hidden/
missing middle” in making healthy diets
affordable for all
As countries grow and transform, urban
populations also grow but follow differential
clustering patterns in different countries or
contexts (Chapter 3). Structural transformation is
accompanied by a rapid increase in large cities
in some countries, while in others by the growth
of SICTs reducing the space between large cities
and the rural hinterland.47, 48 Differential patterns
of population agglomerations have been found
to be associated with different rates of economic
growth and poverty reduction,3, 49 and have
implications for agrifood systems and healthy
diets and nutrition.
 BOX 7 INITIATIVES FOR MORE NUTRITIOUS FOOD AWAY FROM HOME IN SOUTH-EASTERN ASIA
Ready-to-eat foods sold in restaurants, small-scale
eateries or online, and also sold by food hawkers and
street vendors, make up an important part of the diets
of many urban populations in South-eastern Asia.
Many people consume food away from home at least
once a day, and sometimes for all three daily meals.41, 42
Food away from home is also of cultural and economic
importance in the region, with many people relying on
the informal food sector for their livelihood.
Singapore has implemented a comprehensive,
multistakeholder approach, led by the Health Promotion
Board, to improve the supply of healthier options in
the food away from home sector, while also increasing
demand for these options among consumers.
To improve the availability and accessibility
of nutritious foods, the government provides
research-based support to industry to produce healthier
base ingredients such as wholegrain noodles with a
high fibre content. The Healthier Dining Programme43
– building on the earlier Healthier Hawker Programme
and the creation of hawker centres in the early 1970s
to improve the safety of street foods44 – supports
food outlets to incorporate healthy options through
reformulation grants.33 These grants can, for example,
help in covering the cost of buying healthier ingredients,
paying for healthy cooking classes or funding research
and development. Separate grants are available for
promotion of healthier food and drink options.45
To help increase demand, awareness-raising
campaigns have used simple messages to highlight
healthy options. Food items endorsed by the
Healthier Dining Programme are clearly labelled
with “Healthier Choice” meal identifiers on menus/
menu boards, counter tops, shelves and packaging.
In addition, the Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge
campaign46 promotes healthier options and offers
rewards for selection of healthier choices through a
smartphone app.
These elements are supported by a
whole-of-government approach, including a
commitment to use healthier ingredients in all catering
services in government institutes including schools.
This pledge was important for encouraging investment
in product innovation and reformulation.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Food production, especially that of perishables
(such as fruits and vegetables, which are
important elements of healthy diets), tends to
be located in the proximity of urban markets
to minimize transactions and transport costs.50
However, as agrifood systems are transformed
by urbanization, it is not physical distance but
travel time that matters. Thus, food production
located in areas far from urban centres
but with better access to natural resources
(e.g. high-quality soil, water) can be better
suited for supplying these centres, provided the
cost of transport is low and midstream activities
such as processing, logistics and transport are
available and efficient.
The key role of small and intermediate cities and
towns in agrifood systems transformation
Chapter 3 indicated that one-fourth of the global
population live in peri-urban areas of small
and intermediate cities and towns. For poor
populations seeking to increase their physical,
economic and social mobility, SICTs serve as a
“first step” towards migration to bigger cities
(or abroad) but also as an end destination for
permanent migration.3 Proximity of SICTs
to rural areas allows agricultural and rural
households to increase and diversify their
incomes through daily commuting to nearby
towns, seasonal or permanent migration,
and remittances.
In general, the clustering of populations in
only a few localities (i.e. urban concentration in
metropolises) is associated with higher overall
economic growth as a result of economies of scale
and agglomeration when driven by structural
transformation (Chapter 3). Nevertheless, low
skill employment opportunities in non-farm
economic activities generated in SICTs may be
more readily accessible to the poor, who tend
to be unskilled and semi-skilled.38, 39 Properly
targeted public policies and investments
in SICTs could attract private investments
including in agrifood activities, thus creating
employment, increasing demand for food from
local agriculture, and enabling poor people in
those locations to escape poverty and increase
their access to healthy diets (Box 8). Investing in
SICTs is likely to have a more significant impact
on healthy diets both for their populations and
for the populations of their catchment areas
compared to the benefits that trickle down from
growth in large cities.ak
However, in most cases, especially in
lower-middle-income countries (LMICs),
SICTs are constrained from delivering on their
potential for catalysing inclusive agrifood
systems transformation and improving access
to affordable healthy diets. Urban expansion
is unplanned and unregulated, while local
governance is characterized by weak capacity to
plan and execute programmes and insufficient
resources (from national transfers or local
revenue raising) to finance them. This translates
into lack of basic infrastructures and services
(road networks, ports, housing, access to markets,
health, education and social protection), which in
turn limits private investment in growth sectors
and the potential for employment and income
generation.54 For instance, absence of transport
infrastructure connecting rural areas to nearby
towns and intermediate cities has been shown to
negatively affect agricultural productivity and
nutrition.55, 56
Addressing some of the challenges faced by
SICTs can allow agrifood systems to be the
driver of inclusive rural development through
the creation of on- and off-farm employment for
rural households, as well as of increases in food
production and productivity due to increased
food demand, scale economies and expanded
market outlets. This also creates opportunities for
SMEs, which have an essential role to play in this
development, as discussed below.
Supporting midstream small and medium
enterprises to increase availability and affordability
of nutritious foods
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs),
especially in LMICs, play a key role in ensuring
connectivity between primary producers and
final consumers. From a spatial point of view,
SMEs connect the rural hinterland to expanding
urban and peri-urban agglomerations of all
sizes. They include a constellation of midstream
activities involving rural and urban traders
ak This is particularly important considering the analysis presented in
Chapter 2, which shows that the prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity tends to be higher in peri-urban and rural areas around the
world. Please refer also to Chapter 3, in which the importance of SICTs
for poverty reduction is analysed.

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
and retailers, truckers, third-party logistics
firms, storage service providers, processors and
distribution networks.
For SMEs located in SICTs, many are taking
advantage of, inter alia, the closeness to
production areas. However, this is not always
the case: the location of SMEs depends on a
number of other factors including regular supply
of agricultural products, perishability of raw
materials, bulkiness and value of agricultural
commodities vis-à-vis processed products, the
state of infrastructure and transport networks,
electrification, and access to water.57, 58, 59
Midstream SMEs can be fundamental for rural
investment, off-farm employment, modernization
of the agrifood sector, upgrading utilities such
as water and energy, and linking small farms
to expanding urban food markets.60 As such,
they can support livelihoods for agricultural
households and communities and for nearby
populations.61 Strengthening their efficiency and
expansion can also contribute to gains in the
production and productivity of nutritious foods,
and a possible parallel reduction in the cost of
food for consumers. For example, in Kenya more
than 95 percent of the fresh fruits and vegetables
consumed are grown domestically, mainly by
smallholders, and are supplied mainly by SMEs
through informal supply chains.62
The presence of processed foods in household
diets across the whole rural–urban continuum
constitutes a driving force for expansion of the
services provided by SMEs in processing and
distribution, as these enterprises are involved
in a wide range of processed foods (Box 9).63
By transforming perishable raw materials into
palatable products with a long shelf-life, SMEs
contribute to broadening options for consumers,
helping offset seasonality and reducing food
loss. Increased demand for agricultural inputs,
and downstream processing and related
services and logistics, constitute additional
drivers for expansion.
 BOX 8 THE ROLE OF URBAN PROXIMITY IN AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION: CASE STUDIES IN ETHIOPIA
AND INDIA
Evidence largely shows that agriculture practised in
proximity to urban centres is more productive due to
better input prices received, access to input markets
and increased adoption of modern agricultural
inputs. However, less is known about how patterns
of urbanization and the size of urban centres affect
agricultural production.
A study in Ethiopia shows that the proximity to
cities of different sizes has differentiated implications
for farmers’ agricultural intensification decisions: rural
farmers living near a large city such as Addis Ababa
use more modern inputs and achieve higher yields than
farmers near small and intermediate cities and towns
(SICTs). However, in the absence of SICTs, farmers
excluded from the central market in a large city would
most likely remain subsistence oriented. But when the
population is partially distributed in SICTs, farmers
who were initially located too far from a large city to
produce for its market can meet urban demand for food
from SICTs.51
A study focused on the large Indian city of
Bangalore and its surroundings provides evidence that
may confirm the essential role of SICTs in increasing
the use of modern agricultural inputs in rural areas,
by offering improved linkages with markets. In some
cases, farmers located farther from Bangalore show
a higher use of modern inputs due to the influence of
the town of Doddaballapura.52 In addition, evidence of
the potential of SICTs for improving rural livelihoods
through non-agricultural jobs emerges in a later
study in Ethiopia, which shows that the expansion of
SICTs has a positive short-term effect on household
welfare, driven by increased participation in the
non-agriculture sector.53
Policy can strengthen intensification and increased
productivity in farming close to SICTs, by improving
connectivity between farms and input and output
markets, thus reducing the cost of access to both
domestic and international markets and fostering
farmers’ access to and use of modern inputs.
| 114 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Small and medium enterprises can contribute
to nutrition improvements in rural areas by
enhancing smallholders’ access to markets
and inputs. In addition, they can stimulate
upgrading at the farm level by providing
inputs and finance64 and offering differentiated
pricing based on quality. For these reasons,
SMEs have great potential to contribute to rural
poverty reduction and access to healthy diets,
by expanding employment opportunities in the
SMEs themselves, boosting farming incomes
and increasing the supply of nutritious foods.
However, a number of challenges prevent
SMEs from fulfilling their potential and
taking advantage of growth opportunities.
 BOX 9 SUPPORTING INCLUSIVE FOOD VALUE CHAINS IN AFRICA
Investing in agrifood processing creates opportunities
for developing local entrepreneurship and generating
employment and value addition in rural and peri-urban
areas of Africa.65 While most processed agrifood
products have traditionally been imported from outside
Africa, local sourcing of these products is on the rise,
including from cottage industries. This increase is
largely in response to the growing peri-urban and rural
market demand for processed foods.66, 67 If investments
in domestic agrifood processing are not made in African
countries, there will be a continued dependence on
imports for these products.
Capitalizing on this potential requires channelling of
substantial resources towards local agrifood processing
in addition to lowering of barriers faced by local
processors to entry in new and distant (including export)
markets. This requires, inter alia, supportive financial
and market linkage services to connect small-scale
producers in rural areas with traders and aggregators
in peri-urban and urban areas. However, there could be
other approaches. Future research could focus on how
a variety of measures – such as international transfers
as well as trade and fiscal measures in high-income
countries – might also help address the challenges to
financing agrifood processing that African and other
low- and middle-income countries face.14
There are already examples of investments in
agrifood processing in peri-urban areas of Africa.
For instance, in Ghana, the Rural Enterprises
Programme works to improve the livelihood of rural
small and medium enterprises by increasing profitability
and generating growth and employment opportunities.
The project has established sustainable district-level
delivery systems for business development services
in peri-urban centres; offered capacity building and
training related to manufacturing processing equipment
and testing prototypes; and facilitated linkages with
participating financial institutions including rural
and peri-urban banks. Total income, durable assets,
and business income were, respectively, 50 percent,
55 percent and 25 percent higher for beneficiary
households vis-à-vis non-beneficiary ones,68 and
household dietary diversity increased by 10 percent.
Furthermore, women were more likely to manage
self-employment activities jointly with men and have
higher decision-making power related to access
to credit.
In the United Republic of Tanzania, the
Marketing Infrastructure, Value Addition and Rural
Finance Support Programme was created to, inter
alia, provide support to small-scale producers to
overcome the main barriers encountered along the
agrifood value chain. Such barriers include limited
access to credit and inputs, absence of functioning
post-harvest storage facilities, difficult access to
markets, and the dearth of skills to use available
technology. The project rehabilitated rural roads,
strengthened agrifood processing and agricultural
market information systems, supported production and
decision-making capacity of producers and traders
regarding purchase and sale of inputs and outputs,
and increased the capacity of rural and peri-urban
financial institutions, for example by linking them to
the formal banking sector. This resulted in significant
increases in agricultural income, livestock assets
and productive assets for beneficiary households
representing 16 percent, 11 percent and 7 percent,
respectively.69 Crop yields and crop revenues increased
by 29 percent and 18 percent, respectively; household
dietary diversity was also found to have increased by
4 percent. Moreover, women were more likely to hold
decision-making power regarding crop revenues jointly
with men, and were also more likely to be members of
influential groups in their communities.
| 115 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
These challenges are often neglected in
research and national policy formulation
aiming at agrifood systems transformation,
inclusive rural development or urban
planning.70, 71, 72 In LMICs, SMEs are often
scattered, numerous, and small to very small
in size; they are predominantly informal, and
family owned. They face high transaction costs
due to their size but also weak infrastructure,
while their growth is limited by insufficient
access to finance, lack of support for accessing
improved technologies, and lack of policy
initiatives targeting their growth. Because
many of them depend on local sourcing rather
than on a diversified base of commodity
supplies, they face covariate risks with local
farming. The existence of multiple constraints
limits their potential to accumulate assets and
expand operations, including as sources of
employment and income diversification and
as contributors to healthy diets.60 There is
also public underinvestment in specific value
chains that would contribute towards increased
availability of nutritious foods: namely, a
disproportionate amount of public investment
is directed towards staple crop productivity.14
Furthermore, SMEs located in SICTs are at a
competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis larger firms.
Scattered evidence shows that economies of
scale and scope feature more prominently
when intermediaries serve an urban population
concentrated in large cities, rather than one
that is spread across many mid-sized cities,
although more systematic research is needed on
this aspect.70 Women are also heavily engaged
in SMEs, both as workers and as entrepreneurs;
however, they systematically face constraints
to scaling up their business due to financial,
mobility and empowerment gaps.73 In addition,
many SMEs involved in midstream activities are
informal, which may exclude them from public
services and policies that are mostly oriented to
formal agribusinesses.74
It is also important to note that unleashing
the potential of SMEs does not come without
trade-offs between growth and employment and
healthy diet outcomes. Increasing the productivity
and reducing the cost of unhealthy processed
foods (e.g. sugary drinks, bleached flour, refined
starches, oils and sugars) lowers the price of those
foods, thereby creating a cost advantage vis-à-vis
minimally processed or unprocessed items such
as fruits and vegetables.6, 75
The growing middle class food markets in
LICs can be leveraged to increase supplies of
processed nutritious foods.76, 77 In this context,
there are opportunities to invest in processing
SMEs, through the identification of specific
value chains and products that can both be
nutritious and provide value-added livelihood
opportunities for value chain participants.
Examples of this are moringa (moringa powder)
and a range of non-timber forest products.78
Policies and investments to leverage the potential of
the “hidden/missing middle” to provide affordable
healthy diets for all
Policies to enable the potential of SICTs for
growth, poverty reduction and improved access
to affordable healthy diets should facilitate the
flow of people, products and resources between
such cities and their rural catchment areas, but
also expand the reach of local agriculture to
more distant markets. These improvements in
connectivity are also critical for SMEs. Better
linkages between producers, agro-industrial
processors,al agricultural and non-agricultural
services, and other downstream segments of
the agrifood value chain could provide more
opportunities for SME development and, from a
spatial perspective, could turn SICTs into crucial
“food exchange” nodes.am, 5
Building rural infrastructure, including quality
rural and feeder roads to connect remote farms
and enterprises to main road networks, is
essential for unlocking the productive potential
of SICTs and their catchment areas.55, 56 There
is ample evidence that rural roads lead to other
al Within the manufacturing sector, agro-industry develops,
transforms and distributes inputs to and outputs from agriculture,
fisheries and forestry. It includes agroprocessing, a subset of
manufacturing that processes raw materials and intermediate products
derived from agriculture, including food, beverages, tobacco products,
textiles and clothing, wood products and furniture, paper products and
rubber products.
am As stated by Sonnino (2016, p. 190),"by highlighting the centrality
of the relationships between urban and rural areas and actors as
targeted intervention areas, the analysis raises the need for a tighter
scholarly and policy focus on 'connectivities' – i.e. the role of food
exchange nodes and of governance coordination in the design and
implementation of more effective food security strategies."79
| 116 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
investments that can improve nutrition, such as
schools and health services,80 and have positive
impacts on rural dietary diversity, productivity,
incomes and food security outcomes.81 There is
also evidence that as infrastructure and services
develop, midstream activities (especially agrifood
processing) tend to get relocated in SICTs.82
Public investments (in addition to roads) to
support linkages between (mainly small) farms
and SMEs could include warehousing, cold storage,
dependable electrification, access to digital tools
and water supply. Providing this infrastructure,
which forms the basis for a diversified service
industry, is a critical step towards more efficient
functioning of SMEs (Box 10). Such investments
build resilience and contribute to smoothing
income shocks from seasonality, market
volatility and weather variability.83 In order to
attract private sector investment, these public
investments need to be more targeted and part
of more comprehensive national strategies
for infrastructure development. For example,
building “last-mile” infrastructure and logistics
that enable delivery from a distribution centre
or facility to the end user, opens up possibilities
for producers to reach bigger markets and,
in the process, creates conditions that foster
agribusiness development.5, 84
Investment for improving access to markets is
also important for hinterland communities that
are far away from SICTs catchment areas, as is
the case of some Indigenous Peoples. They often
face great difficulty accessing markets, and
thereby have to rely on traders and aggregators,
which may leave them prey to rent extraction.
Existing evidence indicates that improving
market access of Indigenous producers in remote
areas could lead to significant improvements in
economic and livelihood outcomes. In Brazil,
for example, a cooperative effort to improve
market access among Indigenous Peoples’
communities so they could purchase larger
boats, thereby allowing small-scale fishers to
deliver fish directly to markets, contributed
to a 27 percent increase in income,89 mainly as
a result of fishers receiving higher prices for
 BOX 10 STRENGTHENING CAPACITIES OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES TO OFFER SAFE AND
NUTRITIOUS FOODS
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can play an
important role in improving the availability of and access
to healthy diets. However, they often face managerial
and technical capacity gaps. These shortcomings are
compounded by the lack of systematic support to value
chains for producing nutritious foods, especially those
in which the myriad of SMEs are involved.
To strengthen their role in the supply of safe
and nutritious foods, SMEs’ capacities need to be
improved across a range of skills such as business
management, financial planning, marketing, technical
aspects of sustainable agriculture, food quality and
safety, processing, and nutrition. Ensuring food
safety is one of the biggest challenges, as SMEs often
operate in inadequate structures and/or unhealthy
surroundings with no access to basic utilities, using
rudimentary or obsolete technologies, and with limited
application of updated productive, manufacturing and
hygiene practices.85, 86 Filling these gaps will not only
facilitate access to more lucrative markets, it will also
add value to public support programmes that invest
in technologies suited to SMEs (e.g. low-cost cold
storage or solar dryers, affordable packaging solutions,
and labour-, water- and energy-saving processing
technologies). For example, the demand for aquatic
foods has led to the development of innovative practices
to turn processed by-products (about 50 percent of
processed fish with the greatest concentration of
nutrients) and other underutilized aquatic foods such as
seaweed into processed foods to include in local school
feeding programmes.87, 88
Capacity development for SMEs needs to be
integrated into broader programmes to strengthen
value chains of nutritious foods, in order to overcome
the rising production costs associated with unreliable
access to raw materials within fragmented value
chains and upgrade the inadequate storage, power and
transport infrastructures.

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
their fish. In the Philippines, a project aimed at
improving the livelihoods of poor households in
Indigenous Peoples’ communities by developing
market access infrastructures and community
watersheds, and providing financial capital and
capacity-building training, improved small-scale
producers’ market participation by 13 percentage
points. As a result, total income was 32 percent
higher in treatment households than in control
households, and income sources became more
diversified by 6 percent.90
Investments targeting the midstream may
also address multiple constraints elsewhere in
the agrifood value chain leading to win–win
situations of greater economic development
and increased production of nutritious foods.
Combinations of investments in wholesale
markets and feeder roads in China have had
important effects on farming in the market
catchment areas of SICTs by reducing transaction
costs for farmers to reach local markets. This
has increased adoption of vegetable farming
and intensified production.91 In Bangladesh, the
government has made extensive investments
in fish wholesale markets in rural areas to
serve as nodes for the formation of wholesale
and logistics SME clusters across fish-farming
areas, which has encouraged and facilitated
commercialization, intensification, and species
diversification in fish farming.92 In general,
investments in connectivity between locations
and components of agrifood systems in SICTs
have spurred substantial development of
and investments by SMEs and the creation of
spontaneous clusters of wholesale and logistics
SMEs. Such clusters, in turn, induce farmers
to increase their crop variety and to use more
inputs.91,93 In India, the confluence of factors
such as increased demand from urban areas and
improved roads and transport linkages from
rural areas to SICTs, boosted the expansion of
cold storage facilities for potato farmers in places
like Agra and Bihar. The result was reduced
seasonality of potato supply, a diminished role
for traditional rural brokers and shorter supply
chains between farmers and consumers.70
Moreover, recent studies have shown that
investments in public goods such as roads
or storage facilities can reduce trading
costs, thus encouraging farmers to produce
highly profitable foods such as fruits,
instead of low-profitability staple foods for
self-consumption.94, 95 Lower trading costs could
provide the right incentives for smallholder
farmers to shift their production to more
nutritious foods which, considering their
availability gap, could be key for making healthy
diets more available and affordable for all.
This is aligned with one of the main insights of
the 2022 edition of this report, which indicated
that repurposing and stepping up food and
agriculture policy support towards general
services support (which includes investments in
roads and other public goods) could play a key
role in the affordability of healthy diets.
Territorial food markets, including wholesale
markets, constitute a key linkage between
producers, intermediaries, retailers and
consumers in Latin America and the
Caribbean,96 South-eastern Asia, and Africa,
and are often the most important marketing
place for fruits and vegetables.97 Investing in
improved and gender-sensitivean wholesale
market infrastructure (e.g. in territorial food
markets) could improve supply of fresh products
and facilitate compliance with food safety and
quality standards by smallholder producers
(see Box 11),97 incentivize producers to supply
higher-quality foods that could bring them
better returns, and increase the quantity and
variety of food supply through vertical and
horizontal scaling.13
The increased reliance on, and demand for,
processed foods presented in Chapter 3 and
Chapter 4 present both a challenge and an
opportunity regarding healthy diets. Although
food processing is often associated with highly
processed foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt,
it can also be used to improve food nutritional
quality and reduce the cost of a healthy diet.
For instance, improving the nutritional quality
of processed foods and beverages through
reformulation is essential across the rural–urban
continuum:99 it can enhance diet quality,
increasing nutrient content and reducing the
intake of saturated and trans-fatty acids, sugars
an Women account for only 35 percent of wholesale workers
worldwide but, on the other hand, represent 53 percent of all retail
workers in agrifood systems.98
| 118 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
and/or salt in purchased foods.ao In many
high-income countries (HICs), and increasingly
in LMICs, a significant proportion of sodium
in the diet comes from processed foods such as
bread, cereal and grains, processed meats, and
dairy products. Introducing maximum limits
for sodium in such processed foods can promote
reformulation and improve the nutritional
quality of food available.101 To date, 65 countries
have implemented policies to reformulate
manufactured food to contain less sodium
and almost half of the world’s population
ao For instance, in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a reduction in the
intake of trans-fatty acids was observed after the implementation of a
voluntary reformulation agreement. However, no effects were observed
in saturated fat intakes.100
are covered by mandatory trans-fatty acid
limits.101, 102, 103 While reformulation of processed
foods can lead to products with a healthier
profile, it does not eliminate the concern for
high consumption levels of highly processed
foods. For example, often free sugars are
replaced by non-nutritive (or artificial)
sweeteners, which alone does not improve diet
quality. Instead, free sugars should be replaced
with sources of naturally occurring sweetness,
such as fruits, as well as minimally processed
unsweetened foods and beverages.104 Similarly,
fortification is the practice of deliberately
increasing the content of one or more
micronutrients (i.e. vitamins and minerals) in
a food or condiment to improve the nutritional
quality of the food supply and provide a public
 BOX 11 TERRITORIAL FOOD MARKETS, FOOD SAFETY AND HEALTHY DIETS
Territorial* food markets are key retail outlets not only
for fruits and vegetables, but also for animal source and
staple foods, among others. From small villages to large
metropolitan cities, they are an important food supply
source of many products, and are also part of the social
fabric of communities. These markets are a primary
source of affordable, nutritious and fresh foods for
many low- and middle-income groups, and an important
source of livelihood for millions of urban, peri-urban and
rural inhabitants worldwide.106
Territorial food markets are also critical sales outlets
for local producers. In Africa’s food sector, for example,
80 percent of domestic food supplies are purchased
in markets comprising primarily small and medium
enterprises, while only 20 percent remain within farm
households (for own consumption).107 Furthermore,
these food markets are also crucial for providing
employment opportunities to women, who make up a
significant share of retailers. For example, in markets
mapped in Malawi, Paraguay and the United Republic
of Tanzania, women retailers represent a clear majority,
between 57 and 81 percent.108
However, if not well managed, territorial food
markets may represent a global public health risk, as
shown by the major outbreaks of zoonotic foodborne
diseases periodically occurring on every continent.109
The causes of such outbreaks are manifold, including
human–animal interactions, poor infrastructure and
deficient post-harvest handling practices leading to food
contamination by viruses, bacteria, parasites, prions
and chemicals (including toxins, pesticides, industrial
chemicals, metals and persistent organic pollutants).110
Ensuring that nutritious foods are available,
affordable, safe and desirable in territorial food markets
can positively influence people’s dietary preferences
and choices, and thus help to improve their nutritional
status and health. To this end, appropriate regulation
and investment in rehabilitation and renovation of
territorial markets play an important role in promoting
food safety and quality, improving health, enhancing
food security, and strengthening the economy.
These food markets are also ideal settings for engaging
stakeholders (e.g. vendors and local authorities) and
the public to inform consumers about outbreaks and
promote general health (including information on
nutrition).38 The latter is key to nudging consumers
to purchase foods with higher nutritional quality
(e.g. fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and fish).111
NOTES: * Territorial markets refer to markets that are directly linked to local, national and/or regional agrifood systems, and which are mostly organized
horizontally among the various stakeholders. They have multiple functions (economic, social, cultural, etc.) in their respective territory beyond food
supply, and are the most remunerative for smallholder farmers.112

health benefit with minimal risk to health. 
Food vehicles for fortification range from basic
commodities such as various types of flour,
sugar and salt which can be ingredients of
processed foods, to processed foods that are
fortified at the point of manufacture or use.105
Food production policies
As has been indicated in Chapter 3, the
availability of fruits and vegetables per capita
per day is insufficient to meet the requirements
of a healthy diet in most parts of the world. This
makes it essential to boost the production of
nutritious foods and, in general terms, support
the diversification of food production, which has
shown to have positive effects on food supply
and food security.113 In addition, changing food
expenditure patterns across the rural–urban
continuum, as highlighted in Chapter 4, could
send important signals for redesigning food
production policies.ap
Access to inputs such as seeds is key
for supporting production of fruits and
vegetables,115 and this is true across the
rural–urban continuum. Supporting smallholder
farmers in diversifying their production will
have positive effects not only on the overall
supply of nutritious foods, but also on the
accessibility of healthy diets in rural areas.
For example, different kinds of input subsidies
(direct distribution of inputs, vouchers or
targeted preferential prices) have been shown
to have positive impacts in improving access
to diverse and more nutritious foods at the
household level.116 In Ethiopia, a study found
that rural vegetable producers earned more
income and were more food secure than
non-vegetable producers.118 Agricultural
extension is also important in rural areas, and
can have positive effects on dietary diversity
and quality at household levels.81 However,
currently extension programmes are often
oriented towards staple crops rather than
nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables.
ap For instance, a study found changing expenditure patterns in
Zambia from maize towards other cereals such as wheat, as well as to
vegetables and animal source foods, between 1996 and 2015, driven by
income growth and urbanization. However, Zambian agricultural policy
is still focused mostly on maize, undermining the possibilities for
production diversification.114
Changing the focus of these programmes could
be essential for increasing the availability of
these foods.115
As mentioned in the previous section, investing
in infrastructure is key for enhancing agrifood
systems linkages across the rural–urban
continuum. From a productive perspective,
investing in irrigation is important for
boosting fruit and vegetable production, to
the point that in India, producers that have
access to irrigation infrastructure show
better dietary diversity outcomes.119 In cases
in which the conditions and capabilities for
producing diverse nutritious foods have yet
to be developed, biofortification has shown to
be a valid alternative method to improve the
nutrient intake and dietary quality of rural
populations.aq The adoption of biofortified
crops by smallholder farmers can improve
the supply of essential micronutrients not
only via own consumption, but also through
commercialization in local markets and
inclusion in social protection programmes
including in-kind food transfers and school
meal programmes (the latter in all kinds of
settings across the rural–urban continuum).120
It is important to highlight that many studies
in rural settings have found that women’s
empowerment is one of the most important
pathways through which food production
policies can have positive effects on access to
nutritious foods and, in turn, on food security
and nutrition outcomes, particularly in rural
areas. Several studies have found positive
associations between women’s empowerment
and household dietary diversity,117, 121 making
the closure of the gender gap in rural areas
a key consideration for any food production
policy oriented towards improving access to
affordable healthy diets.
On the other hand, in cities and their
surroundings, urban and peri-urban agriculture
(UPA) has the potential to increase the
availability of fruits and vegetables for urban
dwellers.122 In fact, it has been found that
households involved in urban agriculture
improve their dietary diversity through own
aq Please see Section 5.2.
| 120 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
production, and in turn reduce their food
expenditure.123, 124, 125 However, this evidence
is limited compared to that for rural areas, as
there is a gap in the analysis of direct policy
instruments oriented towards food production
in urban areas.ar Still, it has been observed that
the inclusion of urban agriculture objectives in
city planning and regulations, often in HICs, can
create adequate conditions for the development
of urban agriculture.as, 126
The development of UPA is closely linked to
the adoption of productive technologies and
innovations, which can lead to increased yields
and reduced environmental impacts. Considering
the scarcity in urban areas of natural resources
such as land and water needed for the production
of nutritious foods, technology could play an
essential role in making urban agriculture a
sustainable alternative for food supply.126 The
next section provides a detailed analysis of
these technological innovations, as well as other
agrifood systems innovations that could boost
the effects that the different kinds of policies
analysed here could have in making healthy diets
affordable across the rural–urban continuum. n
5.2
TECHNOLOGY AND
INNOVATION: A
KEY ENABLER FOR
AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS
TRANSFORMATION
UNDER URBANIZATION
In an urbanizing world, the strategic deployment
of technology and innovation can be a critical
catalyst of agrifood systems transformation.127
This section discusses the potential of
technology and innovation to contribute to
increasing efficiency, inclusiveness, resilience
and sustainability of agrifood systems under
ar Some cases show direct support of city governments to urban
agricultural producers, but no assessment of their impact has been
found.126
as See Section 5.3 for more details.
urbanization, which are key for making healthy
diets available and affordable for all and, in
turn, achieving food security and nutrition.
Countries have varied needs and capacities
with respect to technologies and innovations,
and there are important differences within
countries and between segments of agrifood
systems. Urbanization offers additional
opportunities for agrifood systems to rapidly
evolve and innovate across the rural–urban
continuum (see Figure 21 in Chapter 3).
Of course, no single “silver bullet” technology
or innovation will meet all needs in all
contexts across the rural–urban continuum.
Furthermore, innovations cannot be considered
in isolation: potential trade-offs and co-benefits
must be considered, both among the
innovations themselves and in relation to other
agrifood systems interventions. For example,
automation can lead to unemployment,
especially for manual labourers/low-skilled
workers, when it is incentivized through
government subsidies in areas where labour is
abundant. However, it also has the potential
to stimulate employment in logistics and
processing due to increased production as
well as generate new jobs that demand high
levels of cognitive ability (this entails building
the knowledge and skills of agricultural
workers to facilitate the transition).128
Therefore, the development and use of
technologies and innovations should be guided
by the assessment of their socioeconomic,
environmental and ethical impacts.
A plethora of technologies and innovations is
available (though not necessarily accessible to
all countries and social groups) spanning entire
agrifood systems. Whether these technologies
and innovations are inclusive for all depends not
only on their adoption and impact, but also on
how research and development (R&D) is shaped.
Between 1981 and 2016, there was a doubling of
global public investment in agricultural R&D,
and larger middle-income countries (MICs), in
particular Brazil, China and India, significantly
increased their investment in agricultural
R&D.129 However, smaller LMICs continue to
have insufficient investment compared to other
components of general services support such as
| 121 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
infrastructure investments.at, 14 The long time
lag between investments and their impact on
the ground, as well as the “invisible” nature of
research and innovation compared to tangible
investments in physical infrastructure, are
contributing factors for this neglect.
Public spending on agricultural R&D is still
lower than private spending. From 1990 to 2014,
private spending on agricultural R&D worldwide
more than tripled (with companies based in
HICs accounting for 88 percent of global private
agricultural R&D spending), but was still focused
on a relatively small number of commodities.131
Venture capitalist investments in the agrifood
technology sector reached USD 29.6 billion in
2022, though this represented a 44 percent decline
from 2021.132 However, the increasingly important
role of the private sector in R&D poses challenges.
The concentration of some key agrifood markets
in the hands of a few multinational corporations
and the increased vertical integration could lead
to an R&D agenda that favours certain financial
interests over sustainability considerations,
and promotes the adoption of high-tech
and high-cost technological and innovative
solutions above others.133, 134 Indeed, looking
at research and innovation trends, it appears
that in highly concentrated markets, the focus
of innovation is primarily on “defensive” R&D,
aimed at safeguarding existing products or
technologies rather than promoting novel ideas.135
Nevertheless, innovative business approaches
used in the private sector could still be beneficial
for agrifood systems: for instance, the idea
of the “circular economy”au is promoting the
development of innovative approaches to reduce
food loss and waste at different stages of the food
supply chain, including at the domestic level.134
An exhaustive and complete listing of
technologies and innovations (including those
in the ever-expanding pipeline) is beyond the
at For instance, an analysis of food and agriculture public expenditure
in 13 African countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Ethiopia, Ghana,
Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Uganda and
United Republic of Tanzania) found that none of these reached the
African Union target of spending an equivalent of 1 percent of their
agricultural GDP on R&D.130
au A circular economy aims to maintain the value of products,
materials and resources for as long as possible by returning them into
the product cycle at the end of their use, while minimizing the generation
of waste.136
scope of this section. Illustrative examples are
provided to showcase diverse options that could
be bundled together in contextually appropriate
packages, and considered as integral elements of
a portfolio of policies, investments and legislation
for transforming agrifood systems to make
healthy diets affordable for all.137 In particular,
there are a multitude of rapidly advancing
digital innovations that cross-cut all segments
of agrifood systems, opening up the possibility
of transforming these systems in unprecedented
ways across the rural–urban continuum, including
offering LMICs opportunities to leapfrog existing
technologies that are less efficient. It is estimated
that by 2050 each farm alone could produce
around 4.1 million data points daily (compared
with 190 000 data points produced per farm
per day in 2014).138 Extrapolating across various
aspects of agrifood systems, such data can
improve the use of public funds by identifying
the most effective and efficient policy options
as well as reducing transaction costs along the
policy cycle (from implementation to monitoring
and compliance to evaluation). For instance, the
use of geospatial data could provide evidence for
policymaking using a rural–urban continuum
lens,139 and it could be particularly important
for improving common and differentiated
policy entry points.
However, innovations in digital technologies
risk increasing the digital divide across
socioeconomic groups (e.g. income, gender
and age), geographies (e.g. rural and urban
populations) and geopolitical groups, in addition
to raising concerns around control of information
and power, democracy and human rights. Some
of the factors to address include the high cost
of some digital technologies, absence of digital
infrastructure, lack of digital skills and literacy,
and sociocultural barriers linked to gender
as well as issues of information asymmetry,
data ownership and management, privacy, and
cybersecurity. Worldwide, 2.7 billion people
do not have access to the internet, and fixed or
mobile broadband services are too expensive
for the average consumer in most low-income
countries.140 Moreover, in LMICs, women are
16 percent less likely to utilize mobile internet
compared to men, while adults residing in rural
areas are 33 percent less likely to use mobile
internet than their urban counterparts.141

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Food environments and consumer
behaviour-oriented technology and
innovation
In urbanizing contexts, where consumers are
increasingly exposed to highly processed foods,
increasing the demand for nutritious foods
is particularly important. The application of
behavioural science is an essential innovation
that enables governments, scientists and
the public to work together to develop
evidence-based approaches to increase access
to affordable healthy diets, as well as empower
consumers to choose healthy diets. When
employed as an iterative, innovation process,
behavioural science can help identify barriers to
consuming a healthy diet as well as help design,
test and scale solutions to overcome them.
Considering that food outlets are a major source
of foods all across the rural–urban continuum,
nudgesav at the point of purchase can be used to
interrupt automated behavioural responses and
redirect them towards healthier food choices.
Nudging interventions in school cafeterias or
local grocery shops have produced positive
results in steering individual dietary choices
towards more nutritious foods in high-income
countries,143, 144 and they would not be too
costly for lower-income countries to emulate
as a useful adjunct to important regulatory
and economic policy tools. For example, a trial
involving ten primary schools in Australia
aimed to encourage the selection of healthier
foods and beverages from the online school
menu. By introducing multiple nudges including
placement (listing healthy items first), prompts
and appealing descriptions of target foods, the
intervention was able to significantly lower
the energy, saturated fat and sodium content
of children’s school lunches compared to a
non-intervention control.145
Food labelling can contribute to a healthy food
environment by providing information to the
consumer about the content of foods, drawing
consumer attention to the benefits and risks
of particular nutrients or ingredients of public
health concern, and motivating manufacturers
av A nudge is any form of choice architecture that alters people’s
behaviour in a predictable way without restricting options or
significantly changing their economic incentives.142
to produce foods which have healthier nutrition
profiles.146 Nutrient profiling is a method that
assesses the nutritional quality of processed
foods and beverages. It is also a tool to guide
policy interventions such as front-of-package
(FOP) or menu labelling and restrictions on
marketing to children to help inform and
empower consumers to shift demand towards
healthy diets. For example, the OBAASIMA
project in Ghana has used a FOP seal and social
marketing campaign to encourage local SMEs
to produce nutritious products. The project
has shown promising preliminary results
in increasing consumer awareness and SME
capacity and is expanding to more cities.54
Regional nutrient profiles have also been
developed as a resource for national or local
policymakers.147, 148, 149, 150, 151
Promoting – while preserving – traditional foods
originating from Indigenous Peoples’ agrifood
systems through labelling and certification
(including territorial labels, geographic
indications and participatory guarantee schemes)
can create niche markets and enhance awareness
of the specificity of such products. For example,
in Ecuador, the Chakra label primarily targets
local markets and sensitizes consumers about
the distinctive sociocultural aspect of the Chakra
system as well as the nutritional value of local
products.152 However, given the large number
of different labels on the market and existing
barriers to compete with global commodity
prices, innovative labels alone may not enable an
upscaling of Indigenous Peoples’ product sales.
Therefore, building relationships and collective
processes together with trusted representatives
of the private sector, especially relevant market
players, as well as governments and researchers
in both social and natural sciences, can be critical
in developing sustainable marketing strategies for
Indigenous Peoples’ food products.
The use of whole genome sequencing can be
an effective tool for identifying and tracing
foodborne pathogens, and for detecting
contaminants as well as outbreak investigations.153
Traceability data, including through mobile
applications, helps inform consumers about the
origin of food sold in supermarkets, promoting
transparency in pricing and making supply
chains more efficient and accountable.154
| 123 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
Online food sharing services can gather
and redistribute food surpluses across local
communities and supermarkets in urban
and rural areas, thus helping to reduce food
waste. They can also have a positive impact on
food environments, especially when surplus
nutritious foods such as fruits and vegetables
are “rescued” and redistributed. Smartphone
applications that enable users to make small
donations to specific initiatives can provide
support for a range of operations, from building
resilience to implementing school feeding
programmes to delivering food assistance in
emergency situations.155
The increased use of mobile phones in LMICs
has contributed to the adoption of other services
such as mobile money, enabling reduced
transaction costs and enhanced financial
inclusion. Mobile money can improve farmers’
access to higher-value markets (thus increasing
their income) and to off-farm income sources
as well.156 In Kenya, Uganda and the United
Republic of Tanzania, it has been shown to have
positive impacts on household welfare, including
in some cases by diversifying food purchases
and improving dietary diversity.157 While the
benefits of using mobile money in rural areas
are already established, the advantages for
urban areas are now being recognized as well –
as seen in Zimbabwe, for instance, where cash
transfers are delivered in urban settings through
mobile money.158
Food labs involve the coming together of a
group of people in complementary roles in order
to experiment with finding novel solutions159
to complex challenges in agrifood systems,
including food insecurity and unaffordability
of healthy diets. Experimenting with, inter alia,
technologies, policies, participatory approaches,
actions and ideas can be an important source of
innovation and capacity building. For example,
the Uganda Food Change Lab was set up to
address district-level issues of limited local
processing facilities, depleted local soils and child
malnutrition, largely a result of undiversified
diets. The lab carried out food dialogues, research
and workshops with a group of diverse actorsaw in
aw Including civil society organizations, local politicians, food
vendors, farmers and traders.
agrifood systems, including those not normally
given a voice, in order to generate stakeholder
awareness. The country’s first People’s Summit
on Food was then convened, resulting in a range
of commitments from all stakeholder groups.160
In Brazil, the collaborative platform, Urban
Laboratory of Public Food Policies (LUPPA),
supports the development and strengthening of
an integrated urban food agenda, while providing
data and content on municipal experiences.
It includes a year-long programme that delivers
an extended repertoire of tools for cities to
become better able to develop their local food
policy strategies. LUPPA’s participant cities
encompass Brazil’s 5 regions, covering 18 of the
26 Brazilian states, and comprising more than
11 million people.161
Midstream food supply chain-related
technology and innovation
Urbanization is leading to a growing demand
for packaged and pre-prepared foods, even in
low-income countries. As analysed in Chapter 4,
consumption of processed foods and food away
from home is higher in urban areas, but there is
a diffusion across the rural–urban continuum.
There is also a noticeable rise in the number
of midstream SMEs involved in wholesale,
transport and processing, as well as upstream
SMEs involved in supplying inputs, especially
in Africa and Southern Asia.162 Small and
medium enterprises are typically embedded in
rural agricultural areas and play an important
role in expanding market opportunities and
strengthening the linkages between urban and
rural areas. As such, innovative approaches
that enhance the capacity of SMEs to increase
the availability of nutritious and safe food,
improve the food environment, and facilitate the
consumption of healthy diets are key.
Innovative business models such as the Egg
Hub operator model (Box 12) can support the
consumption of healthy diets, while providing
small-scale producers with quality inputs and
services as well as market access.
The increasing demand for perishable products
such as fruits and vegetables, dairy products,
meat and aquatic foods has led to a proliferation
of freezing and packaging technologies.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Mobile pre-cooling and pack house units
offer farmers the option of pre-cooling their
produce when there is no immediate access to
cold storage technology.164 Cold chains can be
augmented with internet of thingsax sensors and
big data, allowing for real-time decision-making
for temperature-sensitive products and
perishables as they move across the chain or are
maintained in storage.
Cold chains provide benefits in terms of
maintaining food quality (including nutritional
quality) and safety, reducing food loss and waste,
and facilitating market access, and they are also
key to maintaining the integrity of veterinary
medicines and vaccines to help prevent and
manage outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. However,
cold chains pose significant risks in terms of
ax A system in which devices – including mobile phones, sensors,
drones, machines and satellites – are connected to the internet.165
environmental damage that the refrigeration
equipment can cause. Furthermore, many
barriers impede the use of cold chains in LMICs:
lack of access to reliable power and equipment,
limited resources for public and private sector
investments, inability of small-scale farmers
to afford cooling technologies, and lack of
technical skills, among others.166 Within LMICs,
cold chain capacity and utilization is much
greater for exported food products than for food
destined for domestic markets. Climate-friendly
refrigeration systems based on renewable energy
can help cold chains become more sustainable,
though challenges such as access to reliable and
affordable energy need to be addressed.167
Innovations in food packaging can maintain
the quality, safety and nutritional value of food
products, meet consumer needs and preferences,
reduce food loss and waste, and reduce the cost
of nutritious foods, especially across longer
 BOX 12 EGG HUB OPERATOR MODEL: A SCALABLE WIN–WIN SOLUTION FOR SMALL-SCALE PRODUCERS
AND LOW-INCOME CONSUMERS
The Egg Hub operator model has been piloted by
Sight and Life, a non-profit foundation, in several
countries including Ethiopia, India and Malawi.
This model offers rural small-scale producers access
to urban and peri-urban markets for their surplus.
The producers are organized into groups of five and
given input packages, loans, training and market
support to sell their eggs, as well as wholesale rates
for improved feed. The eggs produced by these groups
are primarily sold within their communities, and not to
commercial establishments where eggs would be used
as ingredients. Any excess eggs are collected and sold
in urban and peri-urban markets. The farmers repay
their loans within three to five years, and the money
from the loan repayments is used to create a revolving
fund to help increase the number of farmers in the
hub. An Egg Hub operator and its affiliated farmers
can cater to a catchment area with a maximum radius
of 100 km.
In Malawi, the first Egg Hub operator model
aimed to produce over 10 million eggs annually
for small-scale producers and rural communities.
The model’s 175 farmers increased their egg
production threefold, allowing them to sell eggs
to consumers at a 40 percent discount, reaching
an estimated number of 210 000 rural poor.
Women particularly benefited, as they were
extensively involved in small animal raising. The Egg
Hub model also provided an added advantage
by helping small-scale producers transition from
backyard rearing to small-scale farm rearing, reducing
the risk of children’s exposure to chicken faeces and
infections. Additionally, the Malawi model proved to
be more sustainable, requiring 69 percent less land
usage, 33 percent less water usage, and generating
84 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions
compared to backyard poultry, primarily due to
lower levels of egg wastage and better biosecurity.
Another crucial aspect of the Egg Hub model is
its ability to address the challenge of small-scale
producers accessing bank loans. By providing access
to quality inputs and a guaranteed market for their
products, the model offers farmers a better chance of
secure funding for their business.163

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
distribution chains. For example, organic sprays
of thin lipids on fruits and vegetables can extend
shelf-life, offering great benefits in countries with
limited refrigeration.168 “Intelligent” packaging
utilizes materials that can monitor the condition
and environment of packaged food, alerting
retailers or consumers to any compromise or
contamination such as changes in colour. It can
also include “smart” labels such as QR codes
that track products throughout the supply
chain, verifying product safety and providing
additional information (e.g. details on allergens
and sourcing). Alternatives to plastic packaging
include biopackaging solutions such as bioplastics
from organic waste streams, though materials
vary significantly in terms of the quantity of
renewable resources used in their formulation,
and may not be as readily compostable as
claimed. Moreover, these solutions remain
difficult to upscale as they must be tailored to
usage requirements.169
Circular packaging solutions can include
redesigning packaging formats and delivery
models, introducing reusable packaging, and
improving the economics and quality of recycled
plastic materials.170 For example, returnable and
transit packaging in the form of returnable plastic
crates is widely used in agrifood value chains
because of its cost-effectiveness, durability and
reusability over extended periods. In Bangladesh,
the switch from single-use plastics to returnable
plastic crates for long-distance transportation
of fresh fruits and vegetables, together with the
application of good management practices, has
improved fresh produce quality and shelf-life
and increased stakeholder incomes while
safeguarding consumers against food safety
risks and considerably reducing post-harvest
losses.171 The development of cross-collaborative
engagement among producers, processors,
retailers and distributors will be critical in
driving the shift from the current, linear
“take–make–consume–dispose” model of the
agrifood value chain, towards more circular
systemic approaches to ensure sustainability.172
E-commerce platforms offer opportunities
to increase affordability of healthy diets, by
shortening value chains and increasing market
access. These platforms can also contribute to
women’s empowerment by enabling women to
earn an independent source of income, work
from home, and set their own working hours.
Moreover, e-commerce has the potential to
reduce the number of intermediaries and balance
the power relationships within value chains,
resulting in higher prices paid for producers and
cheaper produce for consumers.173, 174 The growth
of e-commerce was further accelerated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, from 10 to 20 percent
per year in China, 30 to 70 percent in India,
and 20 to 50 percent in Nigeria,175 and to some
extent, consumers are now more reliant on
food e-commerce (and delivery) than they were
pre-pandemic.83 A key barrier to the adoption
and scaling of e-commerce, however, is the
unequal access to internet connectivity in some
regions. This can limit not only the consumer
base of e-commerce platforms, but also the
possibility for small-scale producers to directly
advertise their products on such platforms,
therefore maintaining (or even increasing) their
reliance on intermediaries for non-traditional
supply channels.
With the rising popularity of e-commerce,
food safety has become a crucial issue for
online retailers. To ensure food safety, retailers
must take measures to prevent contamination
during storage, transportation and delivery. This
includes maintaining appropriate temperatures
for perishable goods, using safe packaging
materials, and implementing proper sanitation
measures. Retailers must also adhere to local
and federal regulations governing food safety.
Clear and accurate information about the origin,
contents and expiration dates of food products is
essential for informed consumer choices and to
mitigate potential health risks.176, 177, 178, 179
The rise of e-commerce due to advances in
mobile technology and widespread wireless
internet availability is shifting the way people
interact with their food environments. This
“digitalization” of food environments is enabling
food retailers to sell foods online, resulting
in unprecedented consumer access to a large
variety of foods (both nutritious foods and foods
of high energy density and minimal nutritional
value). On the downside, online food retail
and meal delivery apps often have specific
promotions on foods high in fats, sugars and/or
salt.180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187 Though mainly used
| 126 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
in urban settings in high- and middle-income
countries, meal delivery apps are growing in
popularity and spreading to smaller cities and
towns, potentially contributing to an expansion
of food swamps by increasing geographic
access to foods prepared away from home188, 189
and/or availability of foods high in fats, sugars
and/or salt in areas where physical shops selling
nutritious foods are sparse. A study analysing
meal delivery apps found, for example,
that a greater number of fastfood options
were available in the most disadvantaged
neighbourhoods.190
Food production-related technology
and innovation
Family farms produce approximately 80 percent
of the world’s food in value terms, with farms
under 2 hectares producing roughly 35 percent.191
Additionally, the majority of the world’s poor
and food insecure live in rural areas and depend
on agriculture for their livelihood.192 Hence it
is critical to increase farm productivity and
incomes in rural areas, enhance market access for
small-scale producers, and improve connectivity
to facilitate smoother flows of goods, services and
information across the rural–urban continuum.
Simultaneously, rapid urbanization combined
with rising incomes is shifting patterns of food
supply and demand, accelerating a diet transition.
Consumption is also changing in rural areas,
leading agricultural production to diversify
towards nutritious foods. Growing fruits and
vegetables can create economic opportunities for
farmers, not only in rural but also in peri-urban
and urban areas. Diversification also increases
resilience to climate, environmental and market
shocks across different production settings.
As already noted, urban and peri-urban
agriculture (UPA) can provide easy access to
fresh and nutritious foods, and make healthy
diets more affordable in peri-urban and urban
areas. In addition, it can help optimize the use of
scarce urban resources such as land and water,
though it is important to exercise caution in
areas which may have contamination issues as
there could potentially be substantial food safety
risks. More than 1 billion individuals residing
in urban and peri-urban regions are involved in
growing food or agricultural activities, and urban
agglomerations encompass a global farm area that
exceeds 60 million hectares.126 Nonetheless, while
UPA can improve food security and nutrition
in and around cities, it is unlikely that it can
satisfy the needs of urban populations, so its
development should be complementary to that
of rural agriculture and concentrate on activities
where there is a distinct comparative advantage,
such as production of fresh, perishable foods.
Numerous technologies and innovations can
be leveraged for enhancing productivity in
rural, peri-urban and urban areas as well as
for closing the productivity gap in LMICs,
especially in the face of the climate crisis and
dwindling natural resources. With water scarcity
becoming a reality in many places across the
rural–urban continuum, technologies such
as rainwater storage can optimize water-use
efficiency in rainfed agriculture.193 For example,
roof-harvested rainwater can positively impact
productivity and improve the sustainable usage
of water in UPA.194 Moreover, the safe use of
wastewater can lead to important energy savings
for food production, and for cities in general.
Nutrients recovered from wastewater can be
used instead of inorganic fertilizers as well.195
In addition, fog catcher systems have been
implemented in arid zones and have increased
the availability of water for food production
in several Latin America and the Caribbean
countries.196, 197
Agroecological innovationsay can be market
based, institutional, ecological and technological,
often with a focus on knowledge co-creation.199
Agroecology recognizes that food production,
distribution and consumption inherently link
economic, ecological and social processes, and
it is practised in diverse and locally adapted
forms across the rural–urban continuum. At the
plot, farm and landscape levels, it can help
increase farmers’ incomes,200 improve food
security and nutrition,201 use water and soil
more efficiently, conserve biodiversity, provide
ecosystem services, and enhance nutrient
ay As stated in FAO (2018, p.1) agroecology is “an integrated
approach that simultaneously applies ecological and social
concepts and principles to the design and management of food and
agricultural systems."198

recycling, among other benefits.202 In India, the
Andhra Pradesh Community-managed Natural
Farming programme that aims to transition all
6 million farmers in the state to agroecological
approaches has already reached more than
630 000 farmers, resulting in higher incomes
and better yields as well as health benefits.203
In Ecuador, the Participatory Urban Agriculture
Programme emphasizes the social inclusion of
vulnerable groups and supports the production,
processing and distribution of food from urban
and peri-urban areas, generating revenue,
creating jobs and promoting agrobiodiversity.204
It also facilitates the provision of technical
assistance, microcredit and capacity building to
producers. Blending agroecology with territorial
approaches can help empower rural communities
and bring agroecology to scale, for example by
implementing territorial certification schemes and
shorter value chains to improve access to markets
and increase incomes of small-scale producers.205
As at 2021, organic agriculture was practised in
191 countries by nearly 3.7 million producers,
but it occupied only 1.6 percent of the total
agricultural land.206 Organic farming systems
can provide more profits with less environmental
footprint and produce nutritious foods with less
pesticide residue.207 In general, organic agriculture
has a positive effect on above- and below-ground
biodiversity, soil carbon stocks and soil quality
and conservation, but it often produces lower
yields than conventional agriculture and has
higher labour requirements.208 MASIPAG, a
grassroots farmer-led advocacy network in the
Philippines, promotes organic farming as a path
for rural development. Farmers are involved in
participatory plant breeding of rice varieties,
farmer-to-farmer exchanges, and participatory
guarantee systems for increased market access
of organic products.209 Organic farming is also
a common practice in UPA, with manure and
urban waste compost frequently utilized to
improve soil fertility. For example, the Kibera
Youth Reform Organic Farm, which began on a
garbage dump in Africa’s largest slum in Nairobi,
grows a range of crops for own consumption
as well as for sale.210 Since organic agriculture
does not rely on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers,
nitrogen availability is the primary impediment
to the global expansion of organic agriculture.211
Additional issues relate to the potential exclusion
of small-scale producers due to the cost of
certification and to the price of organic products,
which are often too high for consumers.212
Controlled environment agriculture (CEA), also
referred to as vertical or indoor soil-less farming,
encompasses numerous technologies including
hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics.
Vertical farming requires only a small plot of
land and can be carried out indoors, allowing for
the cultivation of food in urban and industrial
spaces, and leading to shorter supply chains.
For short-cycle fast-growing horticultural crops
such as lettuce and leafy herbs, production in a
controlled environment can cut water use by up
to 95 percent while supplying consistent-quality,
high-value products all year round. Vertical
farms can minimize risks of foodborne illnesses
and considerably reduce the need for both
inputs (e.g. fertilizers and pesticides) and water
(through recycling). For cereals such as wheat,
studies have shown that yields in indoor vertical
farms could be 220 to 600 times higher than
yields in the field, while at the same time using
less land.213 However, the high energy cost of
producing artificial lighting and maintaining
temperature and air quality makes the adoption
of CEA viable mostly in HICs. The largest
market share from CEA, and most of its positive
results, have been found in this country income
group,214, 215 but it has also been used to support
vulnerable communities in LMICs using
low-tech hydroponic units.216
Biotechnological innovations in genetics
and breeding have led to tremendous gains
in productivity, adaptation to biotic and
abiotic stresses, and enhanced nutritional
value. Consumption of biofortified crops can
enhance nutritional status and promote better
health outcomes, especially in rural areas in
LMICs, where diets are significantly reliant
on self-produced or locally procured staple
crops. Hundreds of biofortified varieties
of 12 staple crops have been released for
planting in over 60 countries, with more
than 86 million people in farming households
eating biofortified foods. In Nigeria, farmers
growing biofortified vitamin A cassava have
been linked to aggregators and processors,
with labelled processed products sold in rural,
peri-urban and urban areas. Additionally,
| 128 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
organizing the annual Nutritious Food Fair
has been instrumental in fostering linkages
among farmers, processors, marketers
and consumers.217
Gene editing is a relatively new technology that
offers improvements in accuracy and precision
for plant and animal breeding, with the added
advantage of speeding up the component
processes at a reduced cost. In particular, gene
editing can be exploited to increase the utility
of “forgotten” crops as well as neglected and
underutilized species that are nutritious and
often adapted to harsh environments and
conditions. Marketed gene-edited products
include a gamma-aminobutyric acid-enriched
tomato and two gene-edited fish in Japan,
as well as soybean with improved fatty acid
composition in the United States of America.218
There are diverse views, however, on how
gene-edited products should be regulated, and
legislation can differ widely among countries.
In addition, prior debates associated with
genetic modification may influence consumer
acceptance of gene-edited products. Public
perception studies vary on whether consumers
can distinguish between genetic modification and
gene editing when forming their opinions. In a
recent study, respondents viewed gene-edited
and genetically modified food similarly, and
less favourably than conventional food. Other
studies suggest that people may be more
accepting of cisgenicaz modifications than of
transgenicba ones, but less accepting compared to
conventionally bred crops.218
Fundamental lifestyle shifts, income disparities,
growing urban population diversity and changing
consumer behaviour in response to numerous
factors (such as concerns about the impact of
food production on environmental sustainability
as well as animal welfare) are disrupting the
status quo of agrifood systems. New foods and
novel ways of producing food are being explored.
The popularity of plant-based alternatives

produced by some gene-editing technologies.218

different species from that of the recipient.219
source foods (e.g. meat, dairy, eggs and aquatic
foods) is on the rise, although caution is needed
to prevent the inadvertent increase in use of
common allergens in diets.220 In addition to food
safety aspects, the price and cultural acceptance
of plant-based alternatives must be considered.
The affordability of plant-based alternatives is
anticipated to improve as consumer demand and
supply grow. Currently, plant-based alternatives
predominantly cater to a Western-style diet, with
limited exploration into more traditional foods in
different regions.
While insects have been a traditional part of
many cultures’ diets for centuries in different
regions, the cultivation of edible insects, for
both human consumption and animal feed, is
garnering significant attention worldwide due
to the many possible advantages in terms of
nutrition, the environment and the economy.
Nonetheless, similar to other food items, edible
insects can be associated with a number of food
safety hazards that require attention and care in
the preparation process.221 Furthermore, a greater
push for the consumption of insects could result
in the overexploitation of insects in their natural
habitats, posing a threat to biodiversity and
ecosystem stability.222
The commercial landscape for cell-based food
technologies that use animal or microbial cells
grown in vitro to produce animal proteins
(sometimes referred to as “cultured” or
“cultivated” meat) is emerging and rapidly
expanding, with Singapore approving the
first cell-based “chicken” nuggets in 2020.223
Cell-based food production is anticipated to
require less land than traditional livestock
farming, though the latter still plays a vital role
in environmental functions such as maintaining
soil carbon content and fertility. Further, it is
unclear if cell-based foods have a greenhouse
gas emissions advantage over livestock when
scaled up. Different types of cell-based foods
have different environmental impacts; for
example, a cell-based food may have high energy
requirements but reduced land-use requirements
and low eutrophication potential.220 It is not
known how people will perceive cell-based foods
and whether they will be acceptable to consumers.
Technological advancements for cell-based
foods have progressed significantly, but they
| 129 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
have not yet reached the stage of widespread
production or commercialization in the majority
of countries. Finally, although the production
costs for cell-based foods have fallen, they are still
prohibitive for many LMICs.
Digital technologies can guide and facilitate
data-driven decision-making at the farm
level across the rural–urban continuum by
leveraging granular data about fields and
animals in conjunction with accurate, timely and
location-specific weather and agronomic data.
Precision agriculture uses information to optimize
inputs (especially targeted, timely applications
of agrochemicals) and can improve resource-use
efficiency in increasingly constrained conditions
for agricultural producers. But efficiency gains
come with a risk of rebound effects, that is
they can lead to enhanced machinery and
associated energy use as well as increases in
usage of natural resources.224 Automation can
replace dull and dangerous manual jobs, address
labour shortages in certain areas and attract
younger, more skilled workers. For example,
agricultural robots can decrease labour and
input requirements, and reduce yield losses
resulting from the late detection of pests and
diseases.225 However, their high purchase price
and operating costs make their use prohibitive
for small-scale producers. Additionally, if
unskilled workers do not learn new skills
quickly enough, it can be difficult to transition
to new jobs. Besides, there is a possibility that
small-scale producers might be driven out of
business and forced to migrate to cities, because
they lack the economies of scale to compete if the
automation technologies are not scale neutral.
Digital services such as shared asset services can
enhance farmer access to mechanization hire
services and significantly reduce transaction
costs for small-scale producers.128 Finally, digital
technologies also have the potential to facilitate
cost-effective, uninterrupted and scalable
extension and advisory services in rural areas.
Mobile phone-based extension systems can reduce
information deficiencies, and in sub-Saharan
Africa and India have been estimated to improve
crop yields by 4 percent and the odds of adoption
of recommended inputs by 22 percent.226
Looking ahead: making technology and
innovation work well for all across the
rural–urban continuum
Globally, urbanization is accelerating, affecting
agrifood systems across the rural–urban
continuum and consequently the availability and
affordability of healthy diets. As evident from
the examples provided above, technology and
innovation are driving changes in production
processes, distribution systems, marketing
strategies, and the food products consumed by
people, with benefits for producers, consumers,
small and medium enterprises and retailers,
among others. However, promising technologies
and innovations often do not gain traction,
especially in low- and middle-income countries,
due to issues of contextual readiness and
appropriateness, and the lack of an appropriate
enabling environment to support development,
diffusion and adoption.
The potential of technology and innovation
can and must be unlocked for the common
good, but all technologies and innovations
have pros and cons in terms of how they affect
agrifood systems transformation and how they
can reinforce inequalities, creating winners
and losers across the rural–urban continuum.
It is also important to acknowledge regional
heterogeneity and the diversity and dynamism
of agrifood systems. Therefore, technologies
and innovations must be adapted to local needs,
opportunities and constraints, to ensure they
are accessible to all who want to adopt them.
To scale up technologies and innovations in
agrifood systems as well as make them more
inclusive, policies and investments are needed
in a number of areas including infrastructure
(e.g. internet and transport connectivity);
relevant capacities, skills and knowledge;
effective regulatory measures; economic and
legal instruments to reduce costs and risks
(e.g. overconcentration of market power);
appropriate market incentives; and promotion
of inclusive agribusiness models. Further,
bundling contextually suitable technologies with
complementary financial, social and institutional
innovations can allow for mitigation of
trade-offs, where one innovation can compensate
for negative impacts caused by another one.7
| 130 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Increased public investment in agricultural
R&D beyond the major staples to include a
broader range of plant and animal species
(including fruits and vegetables) is necessary to
support the diversification of agrifood systems.
Further, the research focus must broaden from
solely improving productivity to improving
the functioning of entire agrifood systems
(i.e. the off-farm components that account for
up to 70 percent of value added). Urban soils
can contain multiple contaminants such as
heavy metals, asbestos and petroleum products
at different levels, while chemical hazards or
pathogens can be found in urban wastewater
that has been improperly treated; therefore more
research is needed on the potential health risks
to humans who consume food that is specifically
grown within urban and peri-urban areas.
Opportunities exist for achieving more with the
resources currently invested by governments.
As analysed in the 2022 edition of this report,14
most of the global support to food and agriculture
is oriented towards producers through price
incentives and other fiscal subsidies. These
subsidies could distort the incentives for adopting
certain technologies, favouring some producers
over others; instead, public support could be
repurposed towards increasing investments in
general services support (which includes R&D)
to encourage the development and adoption of
technologies collectively.14, 128 Reassessing policy
priorities considering the challenges created by
urbanization could open the policy window to
re-examine – and repurpose – current food and
agriculture support.227 n
5.3
INTEGRATED PLANNING
AND GOVERNANCE
MECHANISMS ACROSS
THE RURAL–URBAN
CONTINUUM
The policies, technologies and innovations
presented up until now will require adequate
governance mechanisms that, while engaging
multiple actors, coherently address the
challenges and leverage the opportunities
created in agrifood systems under urbanization.
Policymaking processes will not work with
a traditional, mostly national and top-down
approach, because of the need to focus on
places and their functional and spatial linkages.
Because these linkages often play out across
sectoral and administrative boundaries,
policymaking processes should facilitate
interjurisdictional agreements and regulations,
as well as the participation of a variety
(including non-governmental) of actors.5 Hence,
agrifood systems governance can be understood
as the mechanisms and processes established
for stakeholders to articulate their interest,
mediate their differences and coordinate around
government institutions. Moreover, institutional
arrangements need to consider the key role of
subnational governments (local and regional) as
well as that of non-governmental actors.5
Working with the spatial and functional
linkages across the rural–urban continuum,
with subnational governments as important
players, can leverage agrifood systems
transformation under urbanization. The national
and transnational production-oriented policies
and agendas of the last century created gaps in
addressing food insecurity and malnutrition.
In reaction to these policies, subnational
governments have emerged as important players
in agrifood systems transformation.
Other factors which have increased the role of
subnational governments on the global stage
have been the steady increase in political and
cultural power of cities of different sizes, the
rapid urbanization processes, and the relatively
recent wave of decentralization from national to
local governments in an increasing number of
countries. In the aftermath of these developments,
urban food policy pioneers in municipalities
around the world got engaged in the agrifood
systems agenda to develop food strategies and
implement specific local measures.228
Due to the multisectoral nature of the
challenges and opportunities that urbanization
creates across the rural–urban continuum
(Chapter 3), subnational governments should
also be important actors for formulating and
implementing coherent policies that go beyond
agrifood systems (e.g. environmental, energy,
| 131 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
health and other systems). They are in close
contact with local stakeholders and can ensure
that these policies are adapted to local conditions
by promoting advantages and addressing
bottlenecks. The launch of the Milan Urban
Food Policy Pact in 2015 was a global marker
of subnational governments’ increasing role in
formulating and implementing policies at urban
and regional levels, promoting agrifood systems
linkages across the rural–urban continuum
and integrating different systems approaches
in local, regional and territorial development
plans. The New Urban Agenda, endorsed by the
United Nations General Assembly in 2016, has
been a turning point in terms of recognizing
the role of subnational governments in agrifood
systems transformation, as it called for integration
of food security and nutrition in urban and
territorial planning. This recognition has also
been carried over into global processes such as
the United Nations Food Systems Summit, with
the establishment of the Urban Food Systems
Coalition in 2021 (see Box 13).
Subnational agrifood systems
governance mechanisms
An important starting point towards
streamlining governance based on functional
dimensions across the rural–urban continuum
is the development of locally based agreements
between multiple administrative zones and
multistakeholder platforms and networks.
Multistakeholder agrifood systems governance
mechanisms, involving multiple non-state
actors, farmer organizations, civil society
organizations, the private sector and academic
institutions, are increasingly emerging
as crucial instruments to address gaps in
local policies and planning related to food.
Among such mechanisms, food policy councils
(sometimes also referred to as committees,
food groups, platforms, etc.) serve as advisory
bodies to local or subnational governments,
support policy design and implementation,
promote stakeholder engagement, and facilitate
monitoring and evaluation of progress in policy
implementation, effectiveness, efficiency and
impact (see Box 14).
There is currently very limited evaluation of
the collective impact of food policy councils
on changing policy or shifting conventional
food governance paradigms.230 Some food
policy councils are formed through bottom-up,
citizen-led processes, which makes them
cautious about the degree to which they associate
with or are dependent on local government,
as formalized links with government may
compromise the original vision and direction of
the platform and restrict the ability to propose
 BOX 13 URBAN FOOD SYSTEMS COALITION: A GLOBAL PLATFORM TO RAISE AWARENESS ON THE KEY
ROLE OF SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS IN AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION ACROSS THE
RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
The United Nations Food Systems Summit,
organized in 2021, recognized the importance of
subnational governments as key levers for inclusive
and sustainable agrifood systems transformation.
During the Summit, the Urban Food Systems Coalition
was established; it is currently facilitated by the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
and the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition,
and includes UN Agencies, city networks, civil
society organizations and academic institutions as
active members operating across the rural–urban
continuum in multiple countries. The coalition229 aims
to support national and subnational governments
to transform their agrifood systems by facilitating
coherent, coordinated policies and actions.
It supports subnational governments to engage in
global policy debates and establish themselves as key
players in the overall agrifood systems transformation.
Moreover, the coalition works across the rural–urban
continuum to identify context-specific mechanisms
for bridging national and local agrifood systems
governance gaps.

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
changes to government structures and policy.
Others are formed directly within or even
by the municipality itself and therefore have
strong ties with local government. The strength
of food policy councils with closer ties to
government is that they can be in a better
position to make policy recommendations and
receive more support. Being located within a
government department can also increase the
chances of receiving dedicated resources and
ensure continuity.
Food policy councils have existed for 30 years,
the earliest in Northern America, but they still
require scaling up and strengthened capacity in
order to reach their full potential. For example,
in Africa, the informal sector is expanding,
and street food vending remains key for food
purchases. Informal food vendors provide
poorer households with better opportunities
to achieve food security, as they are spatially
accessible and can offer assistance through
credit;232 however, they are barely considered
in governance mechanisms, not even in food
policy councils, which in most cases are
still in an emerging state (Box 15). Support to
organize these informal food actors in groups
(e.g. cooperatives) can be crucial for their
 BOX 14 SUBNATIONAL AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS GOVERNANCE AGREEMENTS AMONG METROPOLITAN,
INTERMEDIARY AND SMALL CITIES IN PERU
In November 2019, the Peruvian municipalities of
Lima, Huancayo, Arequipa, Piura and Maynas signed
an agreement with the objective of strengthening
agrifood systems linkages across the rural–urban
continuum. The agreement covers: i) linkages
between producers, markets and fairs in different
cities; ii) knowledge exchange on practices related
to agroecology and its promotion in rural and peri-urban
areas; iii) modernization of food retail market spaces;
and iv) context-specific strategies to improve access
to healthy diets. It also includes peer-to-peer learning
practices, which allow for sharing experiences in areas
such as development of new urban food environment
ordinances, public purchase of family farming products,
and establishment of the food policy council in Lima.
One experience shared with municipalities involves
an ordinance in Lima designed to create healthy
food environments in both schools and out-of-home
areas.231 The ordinance prohibits the sale or marketing
of energy-dense foods high in fats, sugars and/or salt
within 200 metres of schools. It also sets minimum
health requirements for food and drinks provided
to students on school premises, and requires
schools to ensure access to fresh drinking water.
Furthermore, as part of the Lima Come Sano (Lima
Eats Healthy) programme, the ordinance requires local
restaurants to adopt new practices to reduce salt and
sugar intakes. To promote healthy eating, restaurants
are encouraged to prominently display the caloric
content of menu items, and to only provide salt shakers
and condiments when customers ask for them.
In addition, in October 2020, Lima established
the Food System Council of Metropolitan Lima
(CONSIAL), which aims to plan, organize, develop
and implement sustainable and resilient food policies
that guarantee the human right to food and generate
a positive impact in reducing rates of poverty and
malnutrition. Since its establishment, the council
has enacted several local ordinances to promote
healthier urban food environments, urban agriculture,
the use of public spaces for agroecology farmers’
markets, and the recovery of unsold food in wholesale
markets. The council includes multiple actors such as
representatives from urban and peri-urban agriculture
platforms, rural producer organizations, civil society
promoters of healthy eating, research centres and
universities, the private sector, and non-governmental
organizations active beyond the administrative
boundaries of the Lima metropolitan area. Likewise,
the council is currently developing an agrifood systems
strategy across the rural–urban continuum, aligned
with the national and international agendas related to
agrifood systems, climate change and sustainability.
The city of Hancayo has also established the Comité
de Sistemas Alimentarios (Food Systems Council) which
is linked to the CONSIAL in Lima, creating the basis for
strengthening agrifood systems governance across the
rural–urban continuum.
| 133 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
integration in the decision-making process.233
However, if formalized, it is important that new
forms of democratic governance do not become
yet another bureaucratic mechanism. On the
contrary, they must remain a place where
problems are addressed through participatory
multistakeholder processes in a holistic way,
and measures are adopted in a way that
includes the interests of multiple stakeholders
including the most vulnerable.232
Once an agrifood systems governance mechanism
has been established, a major common challenge
in local institutions is to ensure its continuity.
Monitoring and evaluation – but also adaptation
as necessary – are required for continuous
learning of local institutions and to report
progress to a wider audience, which could
potentially bring new stakeholders on board
and provide access to additional funding and
technical resources.234
Experience shows that agrifood
governance mechanisms such as food
policy councils perform better if they
are institutionalized within subnational
governments. Institutionalization refers to
the formalization of structures, rules and
practices that enable agrifood initiatives to
endure. It involves creating the policy and
governance infrastructure that will allow a
municipality and key stakeholders to design
new agrifood initiatives and adapt existing
policies and strategies in consideration of
new circumstances;235 to do so requires the
mobilization of human and financial resources.
Finding an institutional “home” to host agrifood
systems-related multistakeholder platforms,
usually in the format of an agrifood systems
“unit” within a municipality, is key to the
sustainability of these initiatives.236
A dedicated budget is also crucial for sustaining
continuity. In most cases, multistakeholder
platforms have limited power to influence
budget allocation for agrifood systems
initiatives. Municipalities themselves have
therefore a critical role to play in integrating
the initiative of an informal food governance
platform into the municipality’s regulatory
framework and budget via ordinances, annual
budgetary and programme planning, or other
types of formal decisions. Due to the diversity
of organizational structures and priorities, there
is no single model for successfully securing
funding. And ultimately, there is no guarantee
that agrifood systems governance will continue
in perpetuity. However, institutionalizing
governance processes can make it harder
for future administrations to erode or
dismantle them.237
 BOX 15 INCLUSIVE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS GOVERNANCE MECHANISM IN KISUMU COUNTY, KENYA, LINKING
URBAN AND RURAL AREAS
In Kisumu County, Kenya, a food liaison advisory
group (FLAG) was established in 2020 under the
leadership of the county and with representatives
from academia, civil society organizations, the
private sector, and farmer organizations operating
across the rural–urban continuum. The FLAG
provides a space to enable dialogue among
different actors and identify priority actions
intended to promote local food production and
processing as well as employment opportunities
and business incubators for women and youth.
This group is currently in the process of finalizing
the development of an agrifood systems strategy
encompassing both rural and urban areas of the
county. The strategy identifies priority areas of
intervention to foster rural–urban linkages, such as
improvement of market infrastructure to improve the
spatial and functional connection between Kisumu
and other counties and as a way to reconnect rural
producers with urban consumers. The strategy is
also in the process of considering inclusivity among
its priorities, particularly in relation to recognizing
and formalizing women street food vendors and
improving their businesses.
| 134 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
Integrated local agrifood systems policies
and planning
The design and implementation of local agrifood
systems policies, investments and legislation for
addressing multiple agrifood systems challenges
and opportunities require working outside the
municipal departmental “silos” and bridging
the gaps between departments and policy areas
in order to achieve systemic changes. Until now
however, most urban food policies have targeted
specific sectors such as food production, food
distribution, waste management, public health or
the environment.238 In the process of integrating
food into urban planning and policy, holistic
food strategies (connecting different and relevant
sectoral domains, municipal departments and
disciplines) are just emerging, setting the overall
framework and agenda within which targeted
policies and actions can be implemented.239
Furthermore, local institutions can align agrifood
systems goals with their broader development
goals through different planning instruments
such as ordinances, by-laws, declarations,
resolutions and codes.
Local agrifood systems policies, planning
and strategies are quite often introduced
through dynamic leadership of “champions” in
municipalities of cities of all sizes, in some cases
working in collaboration with other government
levels and with non-state actors such as
non-governmental organizations, civil society
organizations and academic institutions.240, 241, 242
The history of local agrifood systems strategiesbb
over the past decades has demonstrated how
it is possible to create an effective enabling
environment for mainstreaming agrifood
systems within the local agenda243 and improve
the linkage between rural and urban areas.
Specifically, the development of local agrifood
systems policies, ordinances and regulations
has led to scaling up of ad hoc initiatives and
projects, contributing to the overall agrifood
systems transformation at the national level with
clear multistakeholder engagement (Box 16).
bb Food strategies can initially be developed as a strategic declaration
or a food charter (including strategic lines and communicative in
nature). They can then be further developed as an action plan (including
operative content and defined interventions) and can be politically
endorsed with a budget allocated for their implementation.242
Gathering evidence is the first crucial step to
support the development of local agrifood systems
policies and planning. This process can include a
wide range of instruments and tools: assessment
studies, indicators, open databases, information
sharing platforms, etc. Multiple tools have already
been developed that can inform policymakers
about agrifood systems bottlenecks – i.e. points
in the systems that produce constraints in
economic, social, health or environmental terms
– in order to prioritize interventions, measure
progress and, just as important, draw lessons
on how to effectively integrate agrifood systems
into urban and territorial planning. Developing
comprehensive agrifood systems profiles without
losing the systemic view remains a challenge for
urban policymakers.
The Rapid Urban Food Systems Appraisal
Tool is one example of a tool supporting
evidence-based policymaking at local levels.bc It
assists policymakers and other agrifood systems
stakeholders in developing policies and strategies
that improve food security and nutrition of urban
dwellers and promote sustainable development of
agrifood systems (see Box 17).
Agrifood systems analysis is usually
complemented with evidence gathered through
multistakeholder engagement. While the
availability of disaggregated data for the local
level may be limited, engagement with local
agrifood systems stakeholders can generate
deeper insights for identifying bottlenecks
and prioritizing action. However, it should be
noted that partnerships with stakeholders with
interests that run counter to improving human
and ecosystem health can result in damage and
mistrust. New models for private–public sector
funding will be required to avoid conflicts of
interest and ensure impartiality, accountability
and transparency.244 It is always important to
safeguard against conflicts of interest in policy
development and decision-making – particularly
when multiple stakeholders are involved – and
tools are available to help countries prevent and
manage such conflicts of interest.245, 246
bc Agrifood systems analysis across the rural–urban continuum is
also included in other tools such as the City Region Food System Toolkit,
an online repository of global resources.

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
The priority areas identified at the local
level to develop holistic food strategies and
planning usually include urban and peri-urban
agriculture; short supply chains; inclusive
food markets; healthier food outlets and
street food; public food procurement; sectoral
planning and programming such as school
feeding programmes; inspection of food outlets;
planning and zoning rules on food outlets
and/or marketing; and food waste prevention,
reduction and management.238, 240, 241 Urban and
peri-urban agriculture initiatives have been one
of the catalysing entry points to put food on the
local political agenda. Urban and peri-urban
agriculture has a close relationship with urban
food governance, as it often goes beyond
agroecological production and sustainable
consumption to incorporate other aspects such
as social cohesion, economic development
and environmental issues. Another common
entry point is school feeding whose potential
for improving children’s nutrition, dietary
habits and educational attainment is inspiring
many municipalities, even smaller ones, to
action. School feeding programmes are also
valued for their multiplier effects. They can

HINTERLAND IN ANTANANARIVO, NAIROBI AND QUITO
In Madagascar, the Municipality of Antananarivo
(Analamanga region), collaborating with the Ministry
of Agriculture and other stakeholders, created
a stakeholder advisory group through which the
Agrifood Systems Resilience Strategy 2023–2028 for
the city of Antananarivo and its surrounding region
was developed and validated. The strategy promotes
multisectoral, multilevel and multistakeholder
collaboration, recommending coherent and integrated
implementation of policies and programmes such
as: i) the Integrated Water Resource Management
programme led by the Ministry of Water, Sanitation
and Hygiene; ii) the national Agriculture, Livestock
and Fisheries Investments Programme led by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock; and iii) the
Analamanga Regional Land-Use Plan 2023–2043.
The implementation of these policies and programmes
in Antananarivo and its surrounding region has
the potential to empower local communities while
strengthening resilience to shocks, improving food
distribution, creating employment opportunities and
supporting food small and medium enterprises.
In Kenya, the Nairobi Food Systems Strategy
was endorsed by Nairobi City County and integrated
in the Nairobi City County Development Plan.
Currently in the process of implementation, this
food strategy aims to ensure affordable, accessible,
nutritious and safe food for all, using a multisectoral
approach and working across all levels of government.
An Intergovernmental Relations Committee
on Nairobi City Food Systems was established
including representatives from Nairobi City County
Government and representatives from various
ministries (responsible for food, agriculture, health,
environment, land, water, social protection, etc.).
A multistakeholder food governance mechanism (food
liaison advisory group), which includes non-state
actors, was also established and aims to advise
decision-makers at all levels on the implementation
of the food strategy. Agrifood systems actions across
the continuum will be ensured through the strong
engagement of the intercounty coordination platform
at the national level.
In Ecuador, the Municipality of the Metropolitan
District of Quito endorsed the Quito Agri-food
Strategy in 2019, allowing agrifood systems to
be progressively integrated in city planning tools
such as the Quito Resilience Strategy, Vision 2040,
the Climate Action Plan and the Metropolitan
Development and Land Management Plan (which
recognizes food security as the strategic axis of the
city’s socioeconomic development). The strategy
was developed in collaboration with multiple actors
engaged in the agrifood systems governance
platform. The platform includes local, provincial
and national government representatives; social
movements; international cooperation actors; United
Nations Agencies; academia; and the private sector
(mainly agribusinesses aiming to work in both urban
and rural areas).

 BOX 17 THE RAPID URBAN FOOD SYSTEMS APPRAISAL TOOL: ONE POSSIBLE TOOL TO ANALYSE AGRIFOOD
SYSTEMS ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
The Rapid Urban Food Systems Appraisal Tool
(RUFSAT) aims to assist policymakers and other
agrifood systems stakeholders to develop and
prioritize evidence-based policies and strategies
that address bottlenecks constraining the economic,
social and environmental performance of agrifood
systems. This is achieved through four interlinked
components: i) stakeholder mapping; ii) value chain
analysis; iii) mapping of the institutional and policy
environment; and iv) a consumer survey that includes
a mapping of the food retail environment.
These components are underpinned by geospatial
information systems that bring all the information
related to the agrifood systems and food consumption
patterns within the urban setting onto a common base
map. Maps and information in RUFSAT comprise the
use of satellite imagery, mobile apps for field surveys,
information available in the public domain, and data
collected from local authorities. From these sources,
RUFSAT identifies challenges and opportunities
for planning and transformation of urban agrifood
systems. It relies on feedback and technical advice
from a food liaison advisory group – a working group
of policymakers and subject matter experts created
through a consultative process at the city level
designed to provide input on the assessment findings
as well as guidance on prioritization of challenges and
opportunities at the city level.
RUFSAT assessments provide useful data and
information for the development of local agrifood
systems strategies, ordinances and regulations at
the local level, and have been used in some of the
case studies included in this chapter: the CONSIAL
experience in Lima (Box 14), the Kisumu County
initiative (Box 15) and the Nairobi Food Systems
Strategy (Box 16).
 BOX 18 STRENGTHENING MULTILEVEL INSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENTS THROUGH PUBLIC FOOD
PROCUREMENT IN MANABÍ PROVINCE, ECUADOR
In the framework of the Ecuadorian Food Guidelines,
the Provincial Government of Manabí together with
the municipalities of Portoviejo, Chone and Santa
Ana, and in coordination with the Ecuadorian Ministry
of Education, established a food procurement scheme
to distribute fruits to children as part of their school
meal. This initiative aimed at providing access to
healthy diets for Manabí students, while promoting
income opportunities for farmers. The first deliveries
to schools in Portoviejo, the provincial capital, started
in October 2021 with local fresh fruits from family
farmers located in the rural municipalities of Chone
and Santa Ana. The provincial government financed
the purchase and carried out the procurement
through the public portal, EP Manabí Produce.
Thanks to the initiative, nearly 43 000 children from
95 schools in Portoviejo received, on a daily basis,
a kit comprising nine fresh fruit items (mandarins
and oranges). This initiative has been crucial for
fostering multilevel agrifood systems governance
and interinstitutional coordination across national,
provincial and municipal levels.
| 137 |
CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
be designed to support local agriculture,
strengthen and diversify local agrifood systems,
and improve economic and social development
through public procurement mechanisms
focused on local smallholder farmers and
sustainable production (Box 18). The same
principles can be extended to food procurement
and service policies for other locally run
institutions or services.247
Food waste and circular economy initiatives
are another common entry point for initiating
food planning and policy processes. Food
waste can be converted to compost or used
to produce biogas, thereby avoiding harmful
methane emissions while also creating
employment opportunities; fish offal and waste
can also be used to produce fish silage which
serves as fishmeal in animal feed. However,
this requires municipal organic waste to be
properly managed not only at the household
level, but also in food retailing outlets. Local
institutions play a critical role in creating an
enabling environment to reduce food waste
and adopt waste management practices. For
example, in Bangladesh, municipal food
waste in Khulna city is being used to meet the
high demand for organic compost fertilizer
in the agroforestry sector; but the process
has required support from local institutions
to produce compost at a suitable level. In
relation to food waste management, priority
is also given to prevention, recovery and
redistribution for human consumption – a
process requiring a high level of engagement
of local governments.248 Furthermore, in
Kigali, Rwanda, a thematic multistakeholder
taskforce on food waste management has
been created as part of the broader agrifood
systems stakeholder advisory group addressing
issues related to prevention, recovery,
redistribution and the circular economy. The
Kigali Municipality has assumed leadership
of the platform to strengthen the spatial and
functional agrifood systems linkages across the
rural–urban continuum in Rwanda.
The degree of decentralization in different
contexts and the level of technical capacity can
limit the effectiveness of such local policies
and strategies. For example, despite major
decentralization efforts in recent decades,
local African governments still have low
administrative and fiscal capacity; consequently,
in some cases strategic plans are not implemented
due to lack of funding. Linking food policies and
strategies to the fiscal decision-making process is
therefore indispensable.249
Due to the multisectoral and multilevel nature of
agrifood systems, funding to implement the key
activities of a food strategy and/or action plan
can come from a variety of sources: municipal,
provincial, national, and even non-state actors
such as non-governmental organizations and
international partners. Mobilization of internal
and external resources for effective public
and private financing is crucial, both in terms
of supporting the actions of authorities at all
levels and creating incentives to attract private
capital towards financially viable investment
opportunities.236, 238, 240
Policy coherence at national and subnational
levels remains a key challenge in establishing
the appropriate enabling environment.
National and regional governments usually
have the mandate and resources to invest in
infrastructure development for well-connected
rural and urban areas, and have access to
policy instruments dealing with the role
of the private sector in agrifood systems
transformation.250 As mentioned earlier in
this Chapter 5, investments in general services
support in SICTs could scale up private
investments and take advantage of the closer
spatial and functional links that urbanization
is creating across the rural–urban continuum.
Therefore, these policies and investments will
require strong multilevel governance across
national and regional agrifood systems policies
in order to promote the necessary structural
transformation of agrifood systems. In order
to address a specific issue systemically and
encourage agrifood systems transformation,
coordinated actions across horizontal and
vertical dimensions of governance are needed.
Horizontal governance refers to the coordination
and/or integration among sectoral institutions
(e.g. related to trade, agriculture, health and
planning) and/or with non-governmental
actors such as research institutions, civil
society organizations, representatives of the
private sector, and financial institutions.
| 138 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
For example, as agrifood systems usually
fall under the mandate of multiple agencies,
to improve national coordination among
them, countries are creating interministerial
committees or similar mechanisms to manage
decentralization processes and implement
agroterritorial initiatives. On the other hand,
vertical or multilevel governance concerns the
distribution of power, policymaking capacity
and responsibility across supranational,
national, regional and local government
levels.243, 251 Multilevel governance means
operating and coordinating between and across
the two axes and creating cohesion across
the rural–urban continuum, empowering
all levels of government to take shared
ownership252, 253 (see Box 19).
Conducive policy frameworks for multilevel
governance are still not common, although they
do exist in a handful of countries. A regional
perspective of agrifood systems governance
can become an opportunity for initiating the
process of establishing multilevel agrifood
systems governance mechanisms, such as in
the case of the Catalonia Region, Spain (Box 20).
Moreover, processes of multilevel agrifood
systems governance addressing specific entry
points have been initiated in some countries.
For example, Denmark has started the process
of multilevel agrifood systems governance using
public procurement as an entry point (Box 21).
The establishment of national networks that
engage various levels of government appears to
be an important starting point to initiate such
multilevel governance mechanisms.
Kenya has started the process of promoting
multilevel agrifood systems governance using
urban and peri-urban agriculture as an entry
point. Since 2011, the Urban Areas and Cities
Act in Kenya has required counties to regulate
urban and peri-urban agriculture. However,
although a small number of counties in Kenya
have developed (or are in the process of
developing) holistic food strategies, the shift
from sectoral to systemic for the establishment
of multilevel governance is still at the early
stage with only initial discussions between
national and local governments underway.
 BOX 19 THE MULTISTAKEHOLDER PARTICIPATORY PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING MULTILEVEL INSTITUTIONAL
AGREEMENTS FOR FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE, SOUTH AFRICA
In 2016, the Western Cape Provincial Government
of South Africa published a food security and
nutrition strategy, Nourish to Flourish, which offers
insights into integrated, transversal and multilevel
agrifood systems governance. The strategy is
co-led by the Department of the Provincial Premier
and the Provincial Department of Agriculture.
Informed by the mandates of these provincial
co-leads, the scope of the strategy spans the
rural–urban continuum including rural areas,
small towns and large cities, as well as agrifood
systems that flow into the provincial system.
The development and implementation of the
strategy was founded on a wide-ranging, innovative
consultation and curation process, which brought
together multiple actors including often unheard
voices to improve agrifood systems. The strategy
engages multiple government units, many of whom
are assumed to hold no food or nutrition mandate
(e.g. departments of spatial planning, education,
economic development and environment), while
supporting existing programmes within the
food security realm. Avoiding traditional policy
formulation processes, the strategy retains an
open-ended governance approach, where the
lead government officials continually innovate
and adapt in response to evolving lessons learned
and implementation feedback. Currently, as the
post-2023 South Africa National Food and Nutrition
Security Plan is being drafted, the Ministry of the
President is exploring how the national government
can support this strategy of the Western Cape
Provincial Government, and also how such
strategies can be applied in other regions and what
kind of mechanisms can be created to bridge the
national–local governance gap.

CHAPTER 5 POLICIES AND SOLUTIONS TO LEVERAGE AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS TRANSFORMATION <...>
 BOX 20 THE STRATEGIC FOOD PLAN FOR CATALONIA 2021–2026 AND THE CATALAN FOOD COUNCIL
The Strategic Food Plan for Catalonia 2021–2026 (Pla
Estratègic de l'Alimentació de Catalunya – PEAC) has
been promoted by the Ministry of Climate Action, Food
and Rural Agenda of the Government of Catalonia.
The PEAC is an interministerial and intersectoral
tool that defines the vision, objectives and priority
initiatives and establishes the bases of the Catalan
National Agreement which will serve to guide future
public agrifood systems policies. The PEAC is the result
of a participatory process lasting more than a year
and involving actors of the Catalan agrifood systems,
including primary producers, the food industry, food
distributors, restaurants and catering, research
institutions and universities, and local and national
agencies operating in the food-related sector.
The Catalan Food Council (Consell Català de
l'Alimentació), attached to the Department of
Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food, is the driving
force of the PEAC and acts as a forum for analysis,
debate and proposal on issues related to Catalonian
agrifood policies. It also acts as an agrifood systems
observatory for policy recommendations, and is made
up of a broad representation of associations and entities
related to agrifood systems in Catalonia.
 BOX 21 MULTILEVEL PUBLIC FOOD PROCUREMENT NETWORK IN DENMARK: NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORKING TOGETHER TO INITIATE THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING MULTILEVEL
AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS GOVERNANCE
Public food procurement is an important mechanism
for strengthening agrifood systems linkages across
the rural–urban continuum, thus catalysing
noticeable changes in primary production, dietary
patterns and food education. In 2018, during the
preparation of green public procurement guidelines
for food tenders in Denmark, the National Food
Procurement Network (Nationale Udbudsjuridiske
Fødevarenetværk) – a multilevel food procurement
network for public sector officials – was formally
established by the Danish Ministry of Environment,
together with the chief procurement lawyer of the
City of Copenhagen, to connect the different levels
of government and strengthen the effectiveness of
public food procurement. This formal collaboration
engages the ministry, mayors and 44 national,
regional and local officials, and is an important
step towards the establishment of multilevel
agrifood systems governance. The network has
been created because of the need for closer and
systemic collaboration between the state and the city
level of government regarding the implementation
of state-level rules and regulations. Without this
collaboration, the decisions made at the state level
may prove unfeasible at the local level. Building on
the Danish procurement network, another public
food procurement network has been established at
the European and global levels to share experience
and initiate the process of strengthening multilevel
governance at all levels.
| 140 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
In Indonesia, after the United Nations Food
Systems Summit, the national government
committed to promoting the agrifood systems
approach at all levels. Currently, the national,
provincial and district/city levels are each
required to develop a food security and
nutrition action plan every five years. In
Viet Nam on the other hand, cities have the
mandate to develop the national agrifood
systems action plan. The above frameworks
undoubtedly stimulate policy development
across the rural–urban continuum. However,
there is a risk that the various localities feel
obliged to address national priorities rather
than respond to different local priorities.254
Nonetheless, effective institutional mechanisms
across government levels, in which the voice of
subnational governments inform the national
policy agenda, can create bridges across
geographies and enhance accountability. n

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSION
T his 2023 edition of The State of Food
Security and Nutrition in the World
has provided an update on global
progress towards the targets of ending both
hunger (SDG Target 2.1) and all forms of
malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2). Hunger at the
global level did not worsen between 2021 and
2022, but there are many places in the world
where hunger is on the rise – where people are
still struggling to recover income losses in the
wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, or have been
hit by rising prices of food, agricultural inputs
and energy, or whose lives and livelihoods have
been disrupted by conflicts or extreme weather
events. Progress on important indicators of child
nutrition is to be celebrated, and some regions
are on track to achieve some of the nutrition
targets by 2030. However, rising overweight
among children under five years of age in
many countries portends growing burdens of
non-communicable diseases.
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
is a vision of a healthier, more just and equal
world – a world without poverty, hunger and
malnutrition. While these goals may seem out
of reach, the lack of an increase in hunger may
signal the beginning of a turnaround, and any
improvement in the nutrition of children bodes
well for the future. Achieving food security
and nutrition goals is not only good for those
suffering from food insecurity and malnutrition,
it is good for everyone. A healthier, more just and
equal world is better for all.
Since its 2017 edition, this report has offered an
in-depth thematic analysis of the underlying
causes and drivers of observed food insecurity
and malnutrition trends and how food security
and nutrition SDG 2 targets are related to
other SDG targets. The report has repeatedly
highlighted that the intensification and
interaction of conflict, climate extremes and
economic slowdowns and downturns, combined
with highly unaffordable nutritious foods
and growing inequality, are pushing us off
track to meet the SDG 2 targets. While policy
recommendations have been offered to build
resilience against these adversities, this year
the report underscores the importance of also
considering other important megatrends.
Urbanization has featured as the theme of
this year’s report. With almost seven in ten
people projected to live in cities by 2050, this
megatrend is shaping agrifood systems and, as a
consequence, their capacity to deliver affordable
healthy diets for all and to help eradicate hunger,
food insecurity and malnutrition. Urbanization
also has relevance for SDG 11 (Sustainable
Cities and Communities), SDG 1 (No Poverty),
SDG 2 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 10
(Reduced Inequalities) and SDG 12 (Responsible
Consumption and Production). Therefore, the
findings and policy recommendations from
analysing urbanization in this report can inform
efforts of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development, as well as other ongoing efforts,
including those in the framework of the United
Nations General Assembly-endorsed New Urban
Agenda and the coalitions of action established
after the United Nations Food Systems Summit.
A key conclusion is that the ways in which
urbanization is shaping agrifood systems can only
be understood with a rural–urban continuum
lens; the simple concept of a rural–urban divide
is no longer useful to understand the growing
links across urban, peri-urban and rural areas.
This growing connectivity across the rural–urban

fundamental actors in leveraging multilevel and
multistakeholder mechanisms that, as shown with
concrete examples in this report, have proved
effective in implementing essential policies and
solutions for making healthy diets available and
affordable for all.
New empirical evidence presented in this report for
11 Western, Eastern and Southern African countries
also challenges traditional thinking and reveals
important food consumption patterns, including

the functioning of value chains. Only then
can the challenges and the opportunities that
urbanization creates for agrifood systems
be clearly mapped onto appropriate policy,
technology and investment solutions, as shown
in Figure 37. Implementing these solutions requires
that agrifood systems governance mechanisms
and institutions cross sectoral and administrative
boundaries and rely on subnational and local
governments. Local governments in particular are

THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
dietary convergence across the rural–urban
continuum. For example, it calls into question the
traditional notion that Africa’s rural farmers largely
produce their own food. The affordability of a
healthy diet is actually found to be a critical issue
for rural households in these countries because
they are more – not to say the most – reliant on food
purchases. The new evidence also runs counter
to conventional thinking that purchase patterns
between urban and rural areas differ markedly, at
least for some food groups.
In these countries, the diffusion of processed
foods, including highly processed foods,
associated with urban areas is now seen in
rural areas as well. Unfortunately, low-income
households living in peri-urban and rural areas in
these countries would need to more than double
what they spend on food to secure a healthy
diet. Moreover, food insecurity is no longer a
predominantly rural problem, as levels of both
severe and moderate or severe food insecurity
across urban areas (large, intermediate and small
cities and towns) and peri-urban areas (less than
1 hour travel to large, intermediate and small
cities) were found to be similar to or even higher
than those in rural areas in some of the countries
analysed. The prevalence of stunting, wasting
and overweight in children under five years of
age can also show important variations across the
rural–urban continuum.
Unfortunately, we have learned through this
report that such valuable granular analysis
of food consumption patterns, affordability
of healthy diets, and food insecurity and
malnutrition across the rural–urban continuum
cannot currently be replicated for more
countries and regions of the world, and that
renewed efforts in food security and nutrition
data collection and analysis are needed. The
analysis has relied on the newly available URCA
global dataset, which provides a georeferenced
mapping of the spatial and functional
connectivity across urban, peri-urban and rural
areas, using latitudinal and longitudinal data
of households from the most recent household
surveys. This combination has made it possible
to work with different categories of catchment
areas defined across the rural–urban continuum
for the said 11 African countries. Unfortunately,
georeferenced nationally representative
household survey data are currently only
available for a handful of datasets which have
latitude and longitude information that is
publicly available, and all of them are for Africa.
It is then in the best interest of governments
of other countries and regions that such data
become available for public use, or, if the
data are lacking, that governments invest in
data development to bridge this important
gap. Only then will decision-makers of those
countries and regions be able to rely on an
analysis, similar to that presented in this report,
to inform their policies and investments in
ways that leverage urbanization to accelerate
agrifood systems transformation in the quest to
secure affordable healthy diets, food security
and adequate nutrition for all across the
rural–urban continuum. n

NOTES:
1. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. To reduce the
margin of error, estimates are presented as
three-year averages.
2. FAO estimates of the number of people living in
households where at least one adult has been found
to be food insecure.
3. Country-level results are presented only for those
countries for which estimates are based on official
national data (see note b) or as provisional
estimates, based on FAO data collected through the
Gallup© World Poll, Geopoll or Kantar for countries
whose national relevant authorities expressed no
objection to their publication. Note that consent to
publication does not necessarily imply validation of
the estimate by the national authorities involved and
that the estimate is subject to revision as soon as
suitable data from official national sources are
available. Global, regional and subregional
aggregates are based on data collected in
approximately 150 countries.
4. The estimates referring to the middle of the
projected ranges for the years 2020 to 2022 were
used to calculate the three-year averages.
5. For regional estimates, values correspond to the
model predicted estimates for 2022. For countries,
the latest data available from 2016 to 2022 are
used.
6. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. For countries,
the latest data available from 2005 to 2012 are
used.
7. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. For countries,
the latest data available from 2015 to 2021 are used.
* Wasting under five years of age regional
aggregates exclude Japan.
** The Northern America wasting estimates are
derived applying mixed-effect models with
subregions as fixed effects; data were available only
for the United States of America, preventing the
estimation of standard errors (and confidence
intervals). Further details on the methodology are
described in De Onis, M., Blössner, M., Borghi, E.,
Frongillo, E.A. & Morris, R. 2004. Estimates of
global prevalence of childhood underweight in 1990
and 2015. Journal of the American Medical
Association, 291(21): 2600–2606. Model selection
is based on best fit.
a. Consecutive low population coverage; interpret
with caution.
b. Based on official national data.
c. For years when official national data are not
available, the estimates are integrated with FAO
data. See Annex 1B for further details.
d. Data informing the 2020 food insecurity
estimates come from a national COVID-19 impact
assessment survey with a reference period of
3 months; therefore, comparability with the rest of
the series may be affected.
e. Based on official national data collected in
2019–2022 through EU statistics on income and
living conditions.
f. Most recent input data are from before 2000,
interpret with caution.
g. The UNICEF-WHO low birthweight estimates are
derived through standard methodology applied to all
countries to ensure comparability and are not the
official statistics of the Government of India. India’s
most recent national official low birthweight
prevalence is 18.2 percent from the 2019–2021
National Family Health Survey–5 (NFHS-5), which is
used as the basis of the UNICEF-WHO global
estimation model to support cross-country
comparability.
h. This estimate has been adjusted because the
original estimate did not cover the full age range
or the data source was only representative of
rural areas.
<2.5 = prevalence of undernourishment less than
2.5 percent; <0.5 = prevalence of severe food
insecurity less than 0.5 percent.
n.a. = data not available; n.r. = not reported.

NOTES:
1. Regional estimates are included when more than
50 percent of population is covered. To reduce the
margin of error, estimates are presented as
three-year averages.
2. FAO estimates of the number of people living in
households where at least one adult has been found
to be food insecure.
3. Country-level results are presented only for those
countries for which estimates are based on official

** The Northern America wasting estimates are
derived applying mixed-effect models with

d. Data informing the 2020 food insecurity
estimates come from a national COVID-19 impact
assessment survey with a reference period of
3 months; therefore, comparability with the rest of
the series may be affected.

interpret with caution.
g. The UNICEF-WHO low birthweight estimates are
derived through standard methodology applied to all
countries to ensure comparability and are not the
official statistics of the Government of India. India’s
most recent national official low birthweight
prevalence is 18.2 percent from the 2019–2021
National Family Health Survey–5 (NFHS-5), which is
used as the basis of the UNICEF-WHO global
estimation model to support cross-country
comparability.
h. This estimate has been adjusted because the
original estimate did not cover the full age range or
the data source was only representative of
rural areas.
<0.1 = less than 100 000 people.
n.a. = data not available; n.r. = data not reported. In
the case of the number of undernourished people,
this is because the prevalence is less than

AMONG ADULT MEN AND WOMEN IN 2022

PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT
Definition: Undernourishment is defined as the
condition of an individual whose habitual
food consumption is insufficient to provide, on
average, the amount of dietary energy required to
maintain a normal, active and healthy life.
How it is reported: The indicator (denominated
as “prevalence of undernourishment” [PoU])
is an estimate of the percentage of individuals
in the population that are in a condition of
undernourishment. National estimates are
reported as three-year moving averages, to control
for the low reliability of the estimates of some
of the underlying parameters due to elements
for which complete, reliable information is very
scarce, such as the year-to-year variation in food
commodity stocks, one of the components of the
annual FAO Food Balance Sheets (FBS). Regional
and global aggregates, on the other hand,
are reported as annual estimates, as possible
estimation errors are expected not to be correlated
and therefore to be greatly reduced to acceptable
levels when aggregating across countries.
The entire series of PoU values is revised with each
new edition of this report to reflect new data and
information that FAO has obtained since the release
of the previous edition. As this process usually
implies backward revisions of the entire PoU series,
readers are advised to refrain from comparing
series across different editions of this report and
should always refer to the current edition of the
report, including for values in past years.
Methodology: To compute an estimate of the
prevalence of undernourishment in a population,
the probability distribution of habitual dietary
energy intake levels (expressed in kcal per person
per day) for the average individual is modelled
as a parametric probability density function,
f(x).1, 2 The indicator is obtained as the cumulative
probability that the habitual dietary energy
intake (x) is below the minimum dietary energy
requirement (MDER) (i.e. the lowest limit of the
range of energy requirements that is appropriate
for the population’s representative average
individual) as in the formula below:
PoU = ∫x<MDER f(x|θ)dx,
where θ is a vector of parameters that
characterizes the probability density function.
In the actual computations, the distribution
is assumed to be lognormal and thus fully
characterized by only two parameters: the mean
dietary energy consumption (DEC) and its
coefficient of variation (CV).
Data source: Different data sources are used to
estimate the different parameters of the model.
Minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER): Human
energy requirements for an individual in a given
sex/age class are determined on the basis of
normative requirements for basic metabolic rate
per kilogram of body mass, multiplied by the
ideal weights that a healthy person of that sex/age
class may have, given his or her height, and then
multiplied by a coefficient of physical activity
level (PAL) to take into account physical activity.bd
Given that both healthy body mass indices (BMIs)
and normal PALs vary among active and healthy
individuals of the same sex and age, a range of
energy requirements applies to each sex and
age group of the population. The MDER for the
average individual in the population, which is the
parameter used in the PoU formula, is obtained
as the weighted average of the lower bounds of
the energy requirement ranges for each sex and
age group, using the shares of the population in
each sex and age group as weights. Similar to the
MDER, the average dietary energy requirement
(ADER) (used to estimate the one component of
bd A person is considered healthy if his or her BMI indicates neither
underweight nor overweight. Human energy requirement norms per
kilogram of body mass are given in FAO and WHO (2004).3

NUTRITION INDICATORS

the CV as described below) is estimated using
the average values of the PAL category “Active or
moderately active lifestyle”.
Information on the population structure by sex
and age needed to compute the MDER is available
for most countries in the world and for each year
from the UN Department of Economic and Social
Affairs (UN DESA) World Population Prospects,
revised every two years. This edition of The State
of Food Security and Nutrition in the World uses the
2022 revision of the World Population Prospects.
4
Information on the median height in each sex and
age group for a given country is derived from a
recent demographic and health survey (DHS) or
from other surveys that collect anthropometry
data on children and adults. Even if such surveys
do not refer to the same year for which the
PoU is estimated, the impact of possible small
intervening changes in median heights over the
years on the MDER, and therefore on the PoU
estimates, is expected to be negligible.
Dietary energy consumption (DEC): Ideally, DEC could
be estimated from data on food consumption
coming from nationally representative household
surveys (such as Living Standards Measurement
Study surveys or Household Consumption and
Expenditure Surveys). However, only very few
countries conduct such surveys on an annual
basis. Thus, in FAO’s PoU estimates for global
monitoring, DEC values are estimated from the
dietary energy supply (DES) reported in the FBS,
compiled by FAO for most countries in the world.5
Since the last edition of this report, the FBS
domain on FAOSTAT has been updated with new
values of the series up to 2020 for all countries.
In addition, at the time of closing this report, the
FBS series were updated to 2021 for the following
66 countries, selected as a priority due to the high
contribution they make to the total number of
undernourished people in the world: Afghanistan,
Angola, Argentina, Bangladesh, Benin, Bolivia
(Plurinational State of), Brazil, Burkina Faso,
Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic,
Chad, Colombia, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras,
India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of),
Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar,
Malawi, Mali, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal,
Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua
New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Saudi
Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South
Africa, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan,
Thailand, Togo, Uganda, Ukraine, United Republic
of Tanzania, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of),
Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The revision of the FBS series this year reflects the
inclusion of new official data on food production,
trade and utilization reported by these countries,
as usual, but it also reflects a substantial revision
of the FBS series up to 2021 given the introduction
of improved nutrient conversion factors6
and adjustments needed to consider the new
population estimates provided by the UN DESA
World Population Prospects, 2022 revision.4
Per capita average DES in 2021 (for countries
other than the ones listed above) and in 2022
(for all countries) are nowcast on the basis of the
short-run market outlook exercises conducted by
FAO to inform the World Food Situation Portal7
and used to nowcast the 2021 and 2022 values
of DEC for each country, starting from the last
available year of the DES in the FBS series.
Coefficient of variation (CV): The CV of habitual
DEC in the population is obtained as the
geometric mean of two components, labelled
respectively CV|y and CV|r:
𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = �(𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶|𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦)2 + (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶|𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟)2
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃�𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 = Yes� = exp�𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗�
1 + exp�𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 − 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗�
𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = ∑𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖,𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
FI𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟 = ∑ FI 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿,𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
∑𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
The first component refers to variability in
the per capita consumption across households
belonging to different sociodemographic strata,
and therefore is referred to as the CV “due to
income”, while the second component captures
variability across individuals, due to differences
in sex, age, body mass and PAL that can be found
among members of the same household. As these
are the same elements that determine energy
requirements, the second component is referred to
as CV “due to requirements”.
CV|y
When reliable data on food consumption
are available from nationally representative
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
ANNEX 1B
| 182 |
household surveys, the CV due to income (CV|y)
can be estimated directly. Since the last edition
of this report, 14 new surveys from the following
10 countries have been processed to update the
CV|y: Argentina (2018), Armenia (2019, 2020,
2021), Benin (2019), Bhutan (2012), Cambodia
(2019), Guinea-Bissau (2019), Mexico (2012, 2020),
Mongolia (2020, 2021), Peru (2019) and Uruguay
(2017). That makes for a total of 129 surveys from
65 countries for which the estimate of the CV|y is
based on data from national surveys.
When no suitable survey data are available,
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) data
collected by FAO since 2014 are used to project
the changes in the CV|y from 2015 (or from the
year of the last food consumption survey, if
more recent) up to 2019, based on the observed
trend in severe food insecurity. The projections
are based on the assumption that observed
changes in the extent of severe food insecurity
measured with the FIES might be indicative of
equivalent changes in the PoU. To the extent
that such implied changes in the PoU cannot be
fully explained by the “supply-side” effects of
changes in average food supplies, they can be
confidently attributed to unobserved changes
in the CV|y that might have occurred at the
same time. Analysis of historical PoU estimates
reveals that, on average, and once differences
in DEC, MDER and CV|r have been controlled
for, differences in the CV|y explain about
one-third of the differences in PoU across time
and space. Based on all this, for each country
for which FIES data are available, the change
in the CV|y that may have occurred from 2015,
or from the date of the last available survey, is
therefore estimated as the change that would
generate one-third of a percentage point change
in the PoU for each observed percentage
point change in the prevalence of severe food
insecurity. For all other countries, lacking any
supporting evidence, the CV|y is kept constant
at the last available estimate. As in last year’s
report, the nowcast of the CV|y for 2020, 2021
and 2022 required special treatment to account
for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
(see Annex 2, Section A).
CV|r
CV|r represents the variability of the distribution
of dietary energy requirements of a hypothetical
average individual representative of a healthy
population, which is also equal to the CV of
the distribution of dietary energy intakes of
a hypothetical average individual if everyone
in the population were perfectly nourished.
For estimation purposes, the distribution
of dietary energy requirements of such a
hypothetical average individual is assumed to
be normal and its standard deviation can be
estimated from any two known percentiles. We
use the MDER and the ADER mentioned above
to approximate the 1st and the 50th percentiles.8,
9 The value of CV|r is then derived as the inverse
cumulative standard normal distribution of the
difference between the MDER and the ADER.
Challenges and limitations: While formally the state
of being undernourished or not is a condition
that applies to individuals, given the data usually
available on a large scale, it is impossible to
reliably identify which individuals in a certain
group are actually undernourished. Through the
statistical model described above, the indicator
can only be computed with reference to a
population or a group of individuals for which
a sufficiently representative sample is available.
The prevalence of undernourishment is thus an
estimate of the percentage of individuals in that
group that are in such condition, but it cannot be
further disaggregated.
Due to the probabilistic nature of the inference
and the margins of uncertainty associated with
estimates of each of the parameters in the model,
the precision of the PoU estimates is generally
low. While it is not possible to formally compute
margins of error around PoU estimates, they
are expected to exceed 5 percent in most cases.
For this reason, FAO does not consider PoU
estimates that result lower than 2.5 percent as
sufficiently reliable to be reported.
It is important to note that the ranges presented
for the values of the PoU in 2020, 2021 and 2022
should not be interpreted as statistical confidence
intervals. Rather, they represent different
scenarios used to nowcast the values of CV|y
from 2020 to 2022.

PREVALENCE OF FOOD INSECURITY AS
MEASURED BY THE FOOD INSECURITY
EXPERIENCE SCALE (FIES)
Definition: Food insecurity as measured by this
indicator refers to limited access to food, at the
level of individuals or households, due to lack of
money or other resources. The severity of food
insecurity is measured using data collected with
the Food Insecurity Experience Scale Survey
Module (FIES-SM), a set of eight questions
asking respondents to self-report conditions
and experiences typically associated with
limited access to food. For purposes of annual
SDG monitoring, the questions are asked with
reference to the 12 months preceding the survey.
Using sophisticated statistical techniques based
on the Rasch measurement model, the information
obtained in an FIES-SM survey is validated
for internal consistency and converted into a
quantitative measure along a scale of severity,
ranging from low to high. Based on their responses
to the survey items, the individuals or households
interviewed in a nationally representative survey
of the population are assigned a probability of
being in one of three classes: i) food secure or only
marginally insecure; ii) moderately food insecure;
and iii) severely food insecure, as defined by
two globally set thresholds. Based on FIES data
collected over three years from 2014 to 2016, FAO
has established the FIES reference scale, which is
used as the global standard for experience-based
food-insecurity measures, and to set the two
reference thresholds of severity.
SDG Indicator 2.1.2 is obtained as the cumulated
probability to be in the two classes of moderate
and severe food insecurity. A separate indicator
(FIsev) is computed by considering only the severe
food insecurity class.
How it is reported: In this report, FAO provides
estimates of food insecurity at two different
levels of severity: moderate or severe food
insecurity (FImod+sev), and severe food insecurity
(FIsev). For each of these two levels, two
estimates are reported:
 the prevalence (percent) of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure; and
 the estimated number of individuals in the
population living in households where at least
one adult was found to be food insecure.
Data source: Since 2014, the eight-question FIES-SM
has been applied in nationally representative
samples of the adult population (defined as aged
15 or older) in more than 140 countries included
in the Gallup© World Poll (GWP), covering more
than 90 percent of the world population. In 2022,
interviews were conducted in both telephone and
face-to-face modality. Telephone interviews were
maintained in some countries already covered
with this modality in 2020 given the high risk
of community transmission from conducting
face-to-face data collection during the COVID-19
pandemic. By evaluating dual frame coverage
(i.e. the proportion of the adult population that is
covered by a combination of landline and mobile
phones), countries with a minimum of 70 percent
coverage were included as part of the 2020 GWP
through computer-assisted telephone interviews.
Gallup© traditionally uses telephone surveys in
Northern America, Western Europe, some parts of
Asia, and Cooperation Council for the Arab States
of the Gulf countries. In Central and Eastern
Europe, much of Latin America, and nearly all
of Asia, the Near East and Africa, an area frame
design is used for face-to-face interviewing.

In most countries, samples include about
1 000 individuals, with larger samples of
3 000 individuals in India, 3 500 in China
(mainland) and 2 000 in the Russian Federation.
No data were collected in China (mainland) in 2022.
In addition to the GWP, in 2022 FAO collected data
in seven countries through Geopoll® and Kantar®
with the objective of filling data gaps on access
to food.72 The countries covered were: Cameroon,
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau,
Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda and Zambia.
National government survey data were used to
calculate the food insecurity prevalence estimates
for 60 countries, covering more than a quarter of
the world population, by applying FAO’s statistical
methods to adjust national results to the same
global reference standard. The countries are:
Afghanistan, Angola, Armenia, Belize, Benin,
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Canada,
Chad, Chile, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Fiji, Ghana, Greece, Grenada,
Guinea-Bissau, Honduras, Indonesia, Israel,
Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mexico, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan,
Palestine, Paraguay, Philippines, Republic of Korea,
Russian Federation, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint
Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa,
Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa,
South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Togo, Tonga,
Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Republic
of Tanzania, United States of America, Uruguay,
Vanuatu, Viet Nam and Zambia. Countries are
considered for the year or years when national
data are available. For the remaining years, the
following strategy was followed:
 When more than one year of national
data is available, the missing years are
linearly interpolated.
 If only one year of data is available, missing
years are informed as follows:
– using FAO data if considered compatible
with the national surveys;
– imputed using the trend suggested by FAO
data if national data are not compatible;
– imputed using the trend of the subregion if
no other reliable and timely information is
available; or
– considered constant to the level of the
national survey if the subregion cannot
be computed or the trend of other surveys
or the subregion is not applicable to the
country-specific situation considering
evidence found in support of the trend
(for instance, evolution of poverty, extreme
poverty, employment and food inflation,
among others); this applies also to countries
where the prevalence of food insecurity
is very low (below 3 percent at the severe
level) or very high (above 85 percent at the
moderate or severe level).
Given the heterogeneity of the survey sources
and the small sample size of some of the FAO
surveys, new data can occasionally predict a
notably large increase or decrease from one year
to the next. In such situations, the protocol is
to look for external information for the country
(data and/or reports, possibly in consultation
with country experts like FAO country or
regional officers) to explore whether big shocks
or interventions have occurred. If the trend
can be justified by supporting evidence, but
seems excessive, the trend is kept but smoothed
(for example, using the three-year average).
Otherwise, the same protocol used for missing
years is applied (i.e. keeping the level constant
or applying the subregional trend). In 2022, no
FIES data were collected in China (mainland),
therefore the trend was kept constant.
Methodology: The data were validated and used
to construct a scale of food-insecurity severity
using the Rasch model, which postulates that the
probability of observing an affirmative answer by
respondent i to question j is a logistic function of
the distance, on an underlying scale of severity,
between the position of the respondent, ai
, and
that of the item, bj
.
Prob(Xi,j = Yes) = exp(ai
 – bj
)
1 + exp(ai
 – bj
)
By applying the Rasch model to the FIES data, it is
possible to estimate the cross-country comparable
probability of being food insecure (pi,L) at each
level of severity of food insecurity L (moderate
or severe, or severe only), for each respondent i,
with 0 < pi,L < 1.
The prevalence of food insecurity at each level
of severity (FIL) in the population is computed as
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
| 185 |
the weighted sum of the probability of being food
insecure for all respondents (i) in a sample:
FIL = ∑pi,Lwi
where wi
 are post-stratification sampling weights
that indicate the proportion of individuals or
households in the national population represented
by each record in the sample.
As only individuals aged 15 years or more are
sampled in the GWP, the prevalence estimates
directly produced from these data refer to the
population aged 15 years and older. To arrive at
the prevalence and number of individuals (of all
ages) in the population, an estimate is required of
the number of people living in households where
at least one adult is estimated to be food insecure.
This involves a multistep procedure detailed
in Annex II of the Voices of the Hungry Technical
Report (see link in the “Recommended readings”
section, below).
Regional and global aggregates of food insecurity
at moderate or severe, and severe levels, FIL,r,
are computed as:
FIL,r = ∑c FIL,c × Nc
∑c Nc
where r indicates the region, FIL,c is the value
of FI at level L estimated for country c in the
region, and Nc is the corresponding population
size. When no estimate of FIL is available for
a country, it is assumed to be equal to the
population-weighted average of the estimated
values of the remaining countries in the same
subregion. A regional aggregate is produced only
if the countries for which an estimate is available
cover at least 50 percent of the region’s population.
Universal thresholds are defined on the FIES
global standard scale (a set of item parameter
values based on results from all countries covered
by the GWP in 2014–2016) and converted into
corresponding values on local scales. The process
of calibrating each country’s scale against the FIES
global standard can be referred to as equating
and permits the production of internationally
comparable measures of food insecurity severity
for individual respondents, as well as comparable
national prevalence rates.
The problem stems from the fact that, when
defined as a latent trait, the severity of food
insecurity has no absolute reference against
which it could be evaluated. The Rasch model
enables identification of the relative position
that the various items occupy on a scale that is
denominated in logit units but whose “zero”
is arbitrarily set, usually to correspond to the
mean estimated severity. This implies that the
zero of the scale changes in each application.
To produce comparable measures over time and
across different populations requires establishing
a common scale to use as a reference and finding
the formula needed to convert measures across
different scales. As is the case for converting
measures of temperature across difference
measuring scales (such as Celsius and Fahrenheit),
this requires the identification of a number of
“anchoring” points. In the FIES methodology,
these anchoring points are the severity levels
associated with the items whose relative position
on the scale of severity can be considered equal
to that of the corresponding items on the global
reference scale. The “mapping” of the measures
from one scale to the other is then obtained by
finding the formula that equates the mean and
the standard deviation (SD) of the common items’
severity levels.
Challenges and limitations: When food-insecurity
prevalence estimates are based on FIES data
collected in the GWP, with national sample sizes of
about 1 000 individuals in most countries, confidence
intervals rarely exceed 20 percent of the measured
prevalence (that is, prevalence rates of 50 percent
would have margins of error of up to plus or minus
5 percent). Confidence intervals are likely to be much
smaller, however, when national prevalence rates
are estimated using larger samples and for estimates
referring to aggregates of several countries.
To reduce the impact of year-to-year sampling
variability, country-level estimates are presented
as three-year averages, computed as averages of all
available years in the considered triennia.

STUNTING, WASTING AND OVERWEIGHT
IN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OF AGE
Definition of stunting (children under five years of
age): Height/length (cm) for age (months) <−2 SD
of the WHO Child Growth Standards median.
Low height-for-age is an indicator that reflects
the cumulative effects of undernutrition and
infections since and even before birth. It may be
the result of long-term nutritional deprivation,
recurrent infections and lack of water and
sanitation infrastructures.
How it is reported: The percentage of children
aged 0 to 59 months who are below −2 SD from
the median height-for-age of the WHO Child
Growth Standards.
Definition of wasting: Weight (kg) for height/length
(cm) <−2 SD of the WHO Child Growth Standards
median. Low weight-for-height is an indicator
of acute weight loss or a failure to gain weight
and can be a consequence of insufficient food
intake and/or an incidence of infectious diseases,
especially diarrhoea.
How it is reported: The percentage of children aged
0 to 59 months who are below −2 SD from the
median weight-for-height of the WHO Child
Growth Standards.
Definition of overweight: Weight (kg) for
height/length (cm) >+2 SD of the WHO Child
Growth Standards median. This indicator reflects
excessive weight gain for height generally
due to energy intakes exceeding children’s
energy requirements.
How it is reported: The percentage of children aged
0 to 59 months who are above +2 SD from the
median weight-for-height of the WHO Child
Growth Standards.

Methodology:
Country-level estimates
The UNICEF/WHO-World Bank Group Joint Child
Malnutrition Estimates (JME) country dataset
The UNICEF/WHO-World Bank Group JME
dataset of country estimates requires the
collection of national data sources that contain
information on child malnutrition – specifically,
data on the height, weight and age of children
under five years, which can be used to generate
national-level prevalence estimates for stunting,
wasting and overweight. These national-level
data sources mainly comprise household surveys
(e.g. Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys [MICS],
DHS). Some administrative data sources (e.g.
from surveillance systems) are also included
where population coverage is high. As of the
latest review closure on 28 February 2023, the
primary source dataset contained 1 100 data
sources from 162 countries and territories, with
nearly 80 percent of children living in countries
with at least one data point within the past five
years on stunting, wasting and overweight.
This suggests that the global estimates are
highly representative of the majority of children
across the globe for the most recent period. The
dataset contains the point estimate (and where
available, the standard error), the 95 percent
confidence bounds and the unweighted sample
size. Where microdata are available, the JME
uses estimates that have been recalculated to
adhere to the global standard definition. Where
microdata are not available, reported estimates
are used, except in cases where adjustments are
required to standardize for: i) use of an alternate
growth reference from the 2006 WHO Growth
Standards; ii) age ranges that do not include
the full 0–59-month age group; and iii) data
sources that were only nationally representative
for populations residing in rural areas. Further
details related to data source compilation,
re-analysis of microdata, and data source review
are described elsewhere.10
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
| 187 |
The JME country dataset serves different
purposes for different indicators. For wasting,
the JME country dataset serves as the country
estimates themselves (i.e. the wasting prevalence
in the JME country dataset from a household
survey for a country in a given year is the
wasting prevalence reported for that country
in that year). For stunting and overweight,
the JME country dataset is used to generate
country-modelled estimates which serve as the
official JME estimates (i.e. the stunting prevalence
from a household survey for a given country in
a given year is not reported as the prevalence
for that country in that year; rather, it feeds into
the modelled estimates described in the next
section below).
Country-level model for stunting and
overweight estimates
The technical details of the statistical models are
provided elsewhere.10 Briefly, for both stunting and
overweight, the prevalence was modelled at logit
(log-odds) scale using a penalized longitudinal
mixed model with a heterogeneous error term.
The quality of the models was quantified with
model-fit criteria that balance the complexity of the
model with the closeness of the fit to the observed
data. The proposed method has important
characteristics, including non-linear time
trends, regional trends, country-specific trends,
covariate data and a heterogeneous error term.
All countries with data contribute to estimates of
the overall time trend and the impact of covariate
data on the prevalence. For overweight, the
covariate data consisted of linear and quadratic
sociodemographic index (SDI),be and data source
type. The same covariates were used for stunting,
plus an additional covariate of the average health
system access over the previous five years.
Annual country-level modelled estimates from
2000 to 2022 on stunting and overweight were
disseminated by the JME in 2023 for 160 countries
with at least one data point (e.g. from a household
survey) included in the JME country dataset
described above. Modelled country estimates
were also produced for an additional 45 countries,
be SDI is a summary measure that identifies where countries or other
geographic areas sit on the spectrum of development. Expressed on a
scale of 0 to 1, SDI is a composite average of the rankings of the income
per capita, average educational attainment, and fertility rates of all
areas in the Global Burden of Disease study.
used solely for generation of regional and
global aggregates. Modelled estimates for these
45 countries are not shown because they did not
have any household surveys in the JME country
dataset or because the modelled estimates
remained pending final review at the time of
publication. The results for the 205 countries can
be used to calculate estimates and uncertainty
intervals for any group of countries aggregated.
The uncertainty intervals are important in
monitoring trends, especially for countries with
sparse data and where primary data sources
present large primary data source sampling errors.
When only sparse data are available in the most
recent period, the inclusion of a survey can affect
a substantial change in the predicted trajectory.
For this reason, uncertainty intervals are needed
to enhance trend interpretability in terms of the
caution level employed. The uncertainty intervals
for the new JME method have been tested and
validated with various data types.
Regional and global estimates
Regional and global wasting estimates are
only presented for the most recent year, 2022,
unlike stunting and overweight estimates, for
which an annual time series is available from
2000 to 2022. This is because the JME are based
on national-level country prevalence data,
which come from cross-sectional surveys (i.e. a
snapshot at one point in time) that are collected
infrequently (every three to five years) in most
countries. Since stunting and overweight are
relatively stable over the course of a calendar
year, it is reasonable to track changes in these two
conditions over time with these data, whereas
wasting is an acute condition that can change
frequently and rapidly. An individual child can be
affected by wasting more than once in a calendar
year (i.e. can recover but then become wasted
again in the same year), and the risk of wasting
in many contexts can be driven by seasonal
variations, which can result in seasonal spikes
in prevalence. For example, wasting prevalence,
in some contexts, may double between the
post-harvest season (often associated with higher
food availability and weather patterns that are
less likely to cause disease) and the pre-harvest
season (often associated with food shortages,
heavy rains and related diseases that can affect
nutrition status). Given that country surveys can
be collected during any season, the prevalence
ANNEX 1B
| 188 |
estimate from any survey may be at a high or a
low; or it may fall somewhere in between if data
collection spanned across several seasons. Thus,
the prevalence of wasting captures the situation of
wasting at a specific point in time and not over an
entire year. Variations in seasons across surveys
make it difficult to draw inferences on trends. The
lack of methods to account for seasonality and
incident cases of wasting are the main reasons
why the JME does not present annual trends for
this form of malnutrition.
Generation of regional and global estimates
Different methods were applied to generate
regional and global estimates for stunting and
overweight compared to wasting, as described
below. In short, results from the new country-level
model were used to generate the regional and
global estimates for stunting and overweight,
while the JME subregional multilevel model
was used to generate the global and regional
estimates for wasting.
Stunting and overweight
Global and regional estimates for all years from
2000 to 2022 were derived as the respective
country averages weighted by the countries’
under-five population from the UN DESA
World Population Prospects, 2022 revision,4 using
model-based estimates for 204 countries. This
includes 155 countries with national data sources
(e.g. household surveys) included in the JME
country dataset described above. It also includes
49 countries with modelled estimates generated
for development of regional and global aggregates
but for which country modelled estimates are
not shown, either because they did not have any
household surveys in the JME country dataset
or because the modelled estimates remained
pending final review at the time of publication.
Confidence intervals were generated based on
bootstrapping methodology.
Wasting
The wasting prevalence data from national data
sources described in the above section about
the JME country dataset were used to generate
the regional and global estimates for 2020 using
the JME subregional multilevel model, applying
population weights for children under five years
of age from the UN DESA World Population
Prospects, 2022 revision.
Challenges and limitations: The recommended
periodicity for countries to report on stunting,
overweight and wasting is every three to five
years; however, for some countries, data are
available less frequently. While every effort has
been made to maximize the comparability of
statistics across countries and over time, country
data may differ in terms of data collection
methods, population coverage and estimation
methods used. Survey estimates come with levels
of uncertainty due to both sampling errors and
non-sampling errors (technical measurement
errors, recording errors, etc.). Neither of the two
sources of error has been fully taken into account
for deriving estimates at the country or regional
and global levels.
For the prevalence of wasting, as surveys are
generally carried out during a specific period
of the year, the estimates can be affected by
seasonality. Seasonal factors related to wasting
include food availability (e.g. pre-harvest
periods) and disease (rainy season and diarrhoea,
malaria, etc.), while natural disasters and conflicts
can also show real shifts in trends that would
need to be treated differently from a seasonal
variation. Hence, country-year estimates for
wasting may not necessarily be comparable over
time. Consequently, only estimates from the most
recent year (2022) are provided.

EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING
Definition: Exclusive breastfeeding for infants
under six months of age is defined as receiving
only breastmilk and no additional food or drink,
not even water. Exclusive breastfeeding is a
cornerstone of child survival and is the best
feeding option for newborns, as breastmilk shapes
the baby’s microbiome, strengthens the immune
system and reduces the risk of developing
chronic diseases.
Breastfeeding also benefits mothers by preventing
postpartum haemorrhage and promoting uterine
involution, decreasing risk of iron-deficiency
anaemia, reducing the risk of various types of
cancer and providing psychological benefits.
How it is reported: Percentage of infants aged 0 to
5 months who are fed exclusively on breastmilk
with no additional food or drink, not even water,
in the 24 hours preceding the survey.11
Data source: UNICEF. 2022. Infant and young
child feeding. In: UNICEF. [Cited 6 April

infant-and-young-child-feeding
Methodology:
Infants 0–5 months of age who received only
breastmilk during the previous day
Infants 0–5 months of age
This indicator includes breastfeeding by a wet nurse
and feeding expressed breastmilk.
The indicator is based on a recall of the previous
day’s feeding to a cross-section of infants 0 to
5 months of age.
In 2012, the regional and global exclusive
breastfeeding estimates were generated using the
most recent estimate available for each country
between 2005 and 2012. Similarly, 2020 estimates were
developed using the most recent estimate available
for each country between 2014 and 2020. Global
and regional estimates were calculated as weighted
averages of the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding
in each country, using the total number of infants
aged 0 to 5 months from the World Population Prospects,
2022 revision4 (2012 for the baseline and 2021 for the
current) as weights. Estimates are presented only
where the available data are representative of at least
50 percent of corresponding regions’ total number of
births, unless otherwise noted.
Challenges and limitations: While a high proportion of
countries collect data for exclusive breastfeeding,
data are lacking in high-income countries in
particular. The recommended periodicity of
reporting on exclusive breastfeeding is every three
to five years. However, for some countries, data
are reported less frequently, meaning changes in
feeding patterns are often not detected for several
years after the change occurs.
Regional and global averages may be affected
depending on which countries had data available for
the periods considered in this report.
Using the previous day’s feeding as a basis may
cause the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants
to be overestimated, as some infants who may have
been given other liquids or foods irregularly may
not have received these on the day before the survey.

LOW BIRTHWEIGHT
Definition: Low birthweight is defined as a weight
at birth of less than 2 500 g (less than 5.51 lbs),
regardless of gestational age. A newborn’s weight
at birth is an important marker of maternal and
foetal health and nutrition.12
How it is reported: The percentage of newborns
weighing less than 2 500 g (less than 5.51 lbs) at birth.

teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/monitoring-n
utritional-status-and-food-safety-and-events/
joint-low-birthweight-estimates
Methodology: Nationally representative estimates of
low birthweight prevalence can be derived from
a range of sources, broadly defined as national
administrative data or representative household
surveys. National administrative data are those
coming from national systems including civil
registration and vital statistics systems, national
health management information systems and
birth registries. National household surveys
which contain information about birthweight as
well as key related indicators including maternal
perception of size at birth (MICS, DHS) are also
an important source of data on low birthweight
especially in contexts where many births are
unweighed and/or data heaping is a problem.
Prior to entry into the country dataset, country
data are reviewed for coverage and quality
and adjusted where the source is a household
survey. To be included, available birthweights
from administrative data need to cover at least
80 percent of the UN DESA World Population
Prospects estimated live births for that year. To be
included in the dataset, survey data need to have:
i. a birthweight in the dataset for a minimum of
30 percent of the sample;
ii. a minimum of 200 birthweights in the dataset;
iii. no indication of severe data heaping – this
means that: a) ≤55 percent of all birthweights
can fall on the three most frequent
birthweights (i.e. if 3 000 g, 3 500 g and 2 500 g
were the three most frequent birthweights,
when added together, they would have to
make up ≤55 percent of all birthweights in the
dataset); b) ≤10 percent of all birthweights are
≥4 500 g; and c) ≤5 percent of birthweights fall
on tail ends of 500 g and 5 000 g; and
iv. undergone an adjustment for missing
birthweights and heaping.12
Estimates of low birthweight prevalence at the
national level were predicted from a Bayesian
multilevel-regression model.13 The model is
fit on the logit (log-odds) scale to ensure that
proportions are bounded between zero and one,
and then back-transformed and multiplied by 100
to obtain prevalence estimates.
Hierarchical random country-specific intercepts
(countries within regions within global) accounted
for the correlation within and between the regions.
The six SDG regions were adapted and used in
the modelling. Penalized splines were used as
temporal smoothing across the time series 26–28,
meaning that country-level non-linear time trends
were captured without random variation affecting
the trend. Country-level covariates were also
included in the modelling. The final covariates
included in the model were: gross national income
per person purchasing power parity (constant
2017 international dollars), the prevalence of
underweight among female adults, the adult female
literacy rate, the modern contraception prevalence
rate and the percentage of urban population.
Alongside this, data quality categories (Table A1.5)
were used to apply bias shifts and additional
variance terms. The bias shift was applied to
administrative data from lower quality categories,
which approximated the expected bias from
heaping that was already accounted for in the
survey adjustment. The additional variance
was based on 1) the data quality category of
the administrative data, and 2) the weighting
between administrative and survey data if the
country had both.
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023

Standard diagnostic checks were used to assess
for convergence and the sampling efficiency.
Cross-validation was implemented, averaging
over 200 random splits of 20 percent test data,
80 percent training data. Sensitivity analyses were
undertaken including checks on covariates, bias
method, temporal smoothing and non-informative
priors. All models were fitted in R statistical
software and the R packages “rjags” and “R2jags”.
The model included all 2 040 country-years of data
meeting the inclusion criteria and generated annual
estimates from 2000 to 2020 with 95 percent credible
intervals for 195 countries and areas.bf Only estimates
for countries and areas with data are reported. For
the 37 (out of 195) countries with no data or data
not meeting inclusion criteria, the final model was
used to predict estimates of the prevalence of low
birthweight based on country intercepts and time
trends estimated from the region- and country-level
covariates for all country-years. Regional and global
aggregates were then produced using estimates from
all 195 countries and areas.
Challenges and limitations: A major limitation of
monitoring low birthweight globally is the lack of
birthweight data for many of the world’s children.
Here there is a notable bias, with children born
to poorer, less educated, rural mothers being
less likely to have a recorded birthweight when
compared to their richer, urban counterparts
with more highly educated mothers.13 As the
characteristics of the unweighed are risk factors
bf While the world comprises 203 countries in the FAO regional
grouping, eight countries did not have low birthweight input data or
covariate data. It was therefore not possible to generate any estimates
for these countries, and they are not included in the regional and
global estimates.
for having a low birthweight, estimates that do
not well represent these children may be lower
than the true value. Furthermore, poor quality of
available data with regard to excessive heaping on
multiples of 500 g or 100 g exists in the majority of
available data from LMICs13 and can further bias
low birthweight estimates. The methods applied
to adjust for missing birthweights and heaping
for survey estimates in the current database13 are
meant to address the problem. A recent validation
study found that the adjusted low birthweight
estimate was similar to the true prevalence while
the unadjusted value didn’t capture even half of
the low-weight births in one population.14
The administrative input data also have
limitations, including a lack of individual-level
data, and limited information on heaping
and missing birthweights. The data quality
categorization (Table A1.5) attempted to account
for this by grouping countries according to data
quality indicators, but more robust methods need
to be developed to adjust for administrative data
quality differences at an individual country level
as opposed to having a single bias adjustment
for a group of countries. Furthermore, for
surveys, the standard errors are larger than those
developed for the administrative input data due
to the nature of sampling in household surveys.
These differences in standard errors between
administrative and survey data may affect the
model outcome artificially.
The SDG geographical groupings used in
the modelling may not be appropriate for
epidemiological or economic regional outliers. In
all, the estimates for 37 (of 195) countries without
input data may have been affected. For example,

country intercepts and time trends from the Latin
America and the Caribbean region which may not
be appropriate for this particular country.
In addition, the confidence limits of the regional

given that about half of the modelled countries
had a country-specific effect generated at random
for each bootstrap prediction, some of which were
positive and others negative, making the relative
uncertainty at the regional and global level tend
to be less than that at the individual country level.

ADULT OBESITY
Definition: BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2
. The body mass index
(BMI) is the weight-to-height ratio commonly
used to classify the nutritional status of adults.
It is calculated as the body weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the body height in
metres (kg/m2
). Obesity includes individuals with
BMI equal to or higher than 30 kg/m2
.
How it is reported: Percentage of the population over
18 years of age with BMI ≥30.0 kg/m2 standardized
by age and weighted by sex.15

A900A?lang=en (1 698 population-based studies
with more than 19.2 million participants aged
18 years or older, measured in 186 countries).16
Methodology: A Bayesian hierarchical model was
applied to selected population-based studies that
had measured height and weight in adults aged
18 years and older to estimate trends from 1975 to
2014 in mean BMI and in the prevalence of BMI
categories (underweight, overweight and obesity).
The model incorporated non-linear time trends
and age patterns, national versus subnational and
community representativeness, and whether data
covered both rural and urban areas versus only
one of them. The model also included covariates
that help predict BMI, including national income,
proportion of the population living in urban areas,
mean number of years of education, and summary
measures of availability of different food types for
human consumption.
Challenges and limitations: Some countries had few data
sources, and only 42 percent of included sources
reported data for people older than 70 years.

int/data/gho/data/themes/topics/anaemia_in_
women_and_children
Methodology: The 2021 edition of anaemia estimates
in women aged 15 to 49 years, by pregnancy status,
included data sources from the Micronutrients
Database, part of the WHO Vitamin and
Mineral Nutrition Information System and from
anonymized individual-level data which span
from 1995 to 2020. Adjustments of data on blood
haemoglobin concentrations for altitude and
smoking were carried out whenever possible.
Biologically implausible haemoglobin values
(<25 g/L or >200 g/L) were excluded. A Bayesian
hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate
haemoglobin distributions and systematically
address missing data, non-linear time trends, and
representativeness of data sources. Briefly, the
model calculates estimates for each country and
year, informed by data from that country and year
themselves, if available, and by data from other
years in the same country and in other countries
with data for similar time periods, especially
countries in the same region. The model borrows
data, to a greater extent, when data are non-existent
or weakly informative, and to a lesser extent for
data-rich countries and regions. The resulting
estimates are also informed by covariates that
help predict blood haemoglobin concentrations
(e.g. sociodemographic index, meat supply
[kcal/capita], mean BMI for women, and log of
under-five mortality for children). The uncertainty
ranges (credibility intervals) reflect the major
sources of uncertainty, including sampling error,
non-sampling error due to issues in sample design/
measurement, and uncertainty from making
estimates for countries and years without data.
Challenges and limitations: Despite a high proportion
of countries having nationally representative
survey data available for anaemia, there is still a
lack of reporting on this indicator, especially in
high-income countries. As a result, the estimates
may not capture the full variation across countries
and regions, thus tending to “shrink” towards
global means when data are sparse.

METHODOLOGIES
USED IN CHAPTER 2
A. Methodology for estimating the PoU for
2020, 2021 and 2022
As in previous editions of this report, due to lack
of direct information on the most recent values of
each of the elements that contribute to computing
the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) and
number of undernourished people (NoU) (see
Annex 1B), estimates referring to the most recent
years are nowcasted; in other words, they are
predictions of the very recent past.
As already noted in last year’s edition of this
report, 2020 and 2021 were unique in many
respects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
its lingering effects. This demanded special
considerations when nowcasting the values of
the PoU, especially with respect to estimating
the likely change in the coefficient of variation
(CV) and to modelling the way in which
inequality in access to food contributes to rates of
undernourishment. Both aspects required special
treatment in consideration of the very special
conditions under which food systems operated
during the pandemic.
The strategy used to project values of the CV|y
from 2019 to 2021 and the ranges of global PoU
and NoU estimates followed the same approach
as in last year’s edition of this report, while
additional considerations were made for 2022.
Both are described below.
Projecting CV|y up to 2021
While the values of dietary energy consumption
(DEC) are nowcasted using the traditional
approach based on information provided by
the Markets and Trade Division of FAO, used to
inform FAO Agricultural Outlooks, the traditional
approach used to nowcast the CV had to be
modified to reflect the peculiar conditions of
2020 and 2021. Normally, changes in CV|y (the
component of the CV associated with differences
in households’ economic conditions) are derived
from differences in three-year averages of the
prevalence of severe food insecurity based on
the FIES (FIsev) that are not explained by changes
in food supplies. Use of the three-year average
addressed the need to control for possible excess
sampling variability in country-level estimates
of the FIsev (which, for most countries, is based
on relatively small samples of FIES data) and is
consistent with an assumption that CV|y follows
a relatively stable trend. The exceptional nature
of 2020 and 2021 made it difficult to maintain
that last assumption. Because of that, the changes
between the 2017–2019 average and the 2020
annual values of FIsev were used to nowcast the
2020 values of CV|y, and the changes between the
2020 and 2021 annual values of FIsev were used to
nowcast the 2021 values of CV|y.
Another parameter that needed attention to
nowcast the 2020 value of PoU was the percentage
of change in FIsev (used as a proxy for the
expected change in the PoU) that is attributed
to CV|y. Normally, this had been assumed to
be equal to one-third, based on an econometric
analysis of past values of PoU, DEC and CV|y.
The exceptional nature of 2020 and 2021 called
into question that regularity. As no national
household consumption and expenditure survey
data in 2020 or in 2021 were available, there is
still no empirical basis to determine how to
properly modify it. The solution was to conduct
a sensitivity analysis modifying the percentage
of change in FIsev that is attributed to CV|y from
a minimum of one-third to a maximum of one.
This defined the lower and upper bounds of the
estimated series for 2020 and 2021.
Special considerations for 2022
While the main effects of the COVID-19 pandemic
have receded and data collection began to
normalize in 2022, there is still considerable
uncertainty regarding the extent of the changes
in inequality in access to food that may have
occurred that year. It is not yet known whether
the pandemic and all other disruptive events that
have affected agrifood systems worldwide in the
last three years have had any persisting effect
on the relative roles of demand and supply side
elements in people’s access to food. This, in turn,
demanded a slight modification of the approach
to produce nowcasts of the CV|y, and hence of
the PoU, in 2022.
In particular, the value of 33 percent as probable
contribution of changes in the CV to the observed
| 194 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
changes in the PoU was used to produce the
mid-point of the estimated series, reflecting
what would be a “back-to-normal” situation
(see Annex 1B). Then, additional values of
50, 67 and 100 percent were used, separately
for each country, reflecting possible different
assumptions about the way in which CV|y might
have contributed to PoU in 2022. Note however
that, contrary to what was the case in 2020 and
2021, when FIES-based estimates revealed food
insecurity worsening practically everywhere, the
implications of assuming greater contribution of
changes in the CV towards changes in the PoU are
somehow opposite for the 2022 value. Considering
that estimates of the prevalence of severe food
insecurity showed an improvement for many
countries from 2021 to 2022, for those countries
we project a reduction, rather than an increase
in CV|y. Combining the set of all lowest and the
set of all highest country estimates, we obtain,
respectively, lower and upper bounds for the
global and regional series. Overall, the result is
a slightly narrower range of global PoU and NoU
estimates in 2022 compared to the previous two
years (Table A2.1).
Table A2.1 presents the lower and upper bounds
of the PoU in 2020, 2021 and 2022 at the global,
regional and subregional levels.
B. Methodology for projections of PoU
to 2030
To project PoU values to 2030, we project the
three fundamental variables that enter in the
PoU formula (DEC, CV and MDER) separately,

based on different inputs, depending on the
scenario considered.
The main source of information is the output of
the MIRAGRODEP recursive, dynamic computable
general equilibrium model, which provides series
of projected values, at the country level, for:
 real per capita GDP (GDP_Vol_pc);
 income Gini coefficient (gini_income);
 an index of real food price (Prices_Real_Food);
 extreme poverty headcount rate (that is, the
percentage of the population with real daily
income below USD 2.15 (x215_ALL); and
 daily per capita food consumption (DES_Kcal).
The MIRAGRODEP model was calibrated to the
pre-pandemic situation of the world economy
in 2018 and was used to generate projections of
macroeconomic fundamentals into 2019–2030
under three scenarios: 1) “before COVID-19”,
which aims to capture the implications for food
availability and access (and therefore the PoU)
of the world economic prospects as seen before
the eruption of the pandemic by the IMF World
Economic Outlook published in October 2019;
2) “before the war in Ukraine”, which does the
same but considering the World Economic Outlook
published in October 2021; and 3) “current
prospects”, which is based on the latest World
Economic Outlook published in April 2023.17 A
more detailed description of the MIRAGRODEP
model, as well as the assumptions used to build
the various scenarios, can be found in Laborde
and Torero (2023).18
In addition, we use the median variant projections
of total population (both sexes), its composition
by gender and age, and the crude birth rate as
provided by the 2022 revision of the UN DESA
World Population Prospects.

Projections of DEC

where T = 2019 for “before COVID-19”, T = 2021
for “before the war in Ukraine", and T = 2022 for
“current prospects”.
In other words, we take the model projected
series of DES_Kcal and adjust its level so that the
value for year T matches the actual value. (This is
necessary as the MIRAGRODEP model has been
calibrated to an older FBS series.)
Projections of MDER
To project the MDER, we simply compute it based
on the data on the composition of the population
by sex and age as projected by the 2019 World
Population Prospects4 (medium variant).

PoU in Annex 1B, the total CV is computed as

To estimate the coefficients used in the above
formula, in this edition of the report we
considered alternative models that represent
an improvement compared to the model
used in 2022. As summarized in Table A2.2, the
coefficients in the three alternative models are
very similar and therefore generate very similar
predictions when fed with the same series of
projected independent variables obtained from
the MIRAGRODEP model and from the World
Population Prospects, 2022 revision.4
While the estimation strategy, based on a
random-effects linear regression, remains the
same as in previous years, the main differences
compared to the model used to generate
| 196 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
projections of CV|y in 2022 reside in the set of
historical data used to feed the estimation model.
First, this year we used the new series of
historical values of CV|y that inform the current
series of PoU estimates presented in Table 1 and
Table A1 of this report, which include a revision
of some estimates obtained from data from food
consumption surveys that had been used before
but that have been reprocessed by considering
improved and updated food composition tables,
and values derived from the brand new analysis
of 14 additional surveys (see the methodological
note for the PoU in Annex 1B).
Most importantly, though, this year we use newly
sourced series of historical data on real GDP
per capita, income Gini coefficient, real food
consumer price index (CPI), poverty headcount,
crude birth rate and total population. For poverty
headcount and income Gini we restricted our
sample to household survey-based estimates that
are published on the new Poverty and Inequality
Platform (PIP) of the World Bank, which replaces
both PovcalNet and the Poverty and Equity
Data Portal that were phased out in March 2022.
The major consequence of relying only on the
household survey-based values in the series
sourced from the PIP is a reduction in the number
of country/year combinations for which direct
estimates of income Gini and poverty headcount
are available. That brings the number of data
points we can use to estimate our model down to
75 from the 119 used in 2022.
In addition, all economic series available through
PIP and IMF World Economic Outlook have been
updated to reflect the 2017-based revision of
purchasing power parity (PPP) published by the
International Comparison Program (ICP).19
As there have been various data updates and
the differences in the estimated coefficients
between the model used in 2022 and the model
used this year (Model 3) are quite relevant,
leading to slightly different and more optimistic
projections of reductions in CV|y, we estimated
two additional intermediate models to
disentangle the reasons for the different results.
We first estimated a model (Model 1 in Table A2.2)
using the old set of data for both dependent
and independent variables but limited to the
69 country/year combinations that overlap
between the 119 used in 2022 and the 75 used
this year. Then, we moved to using the newly
sourced data from PIP but keeping the poverty
headcount values from the 2011-based PPP
(Model 2), before adopting all new versions of the
variables in the model we ultimately use for our
projections (Model 3).

 TABLE A2.2 REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS FROM THREE ALTERNATIVE MODELS ESTIMATED ON HISTORICAL
CV|y VALUES (2000–2018) AND COMPARISON WITH THE MODEL USED IN 2022
| 197 |
ANNEX 2
By comparing the values of the estimated
coefficients in columns 3–6 of Table A2.2, we
note that the main impact derives from having
dropped country/year combinations that relied on
interpolated or modelled poverty headcount and
income Gini coefficients: when moving from the
model used in 2022 to Model 1, the coefficients of
real GDP per capita and of income Gini increase,
both in absolute value and in the level of their
statistical significance. Another noticeable effect
can be linked to the updates of data to their 2023
version and the addition of six more country/year
combinations: the coefficients of real GDP per
capita, income Gini and of real food CPI further
increase, while the one on the poverty headcount
decreases in Model 2 compared to Model 1.
Finally, updating the poverty headcount to the
2017-based PPP has overall negligible effects as
the coefficients in Model 2 and Model 3 are very
close to each other for all variables (with the
partial exception of the poverty headcount, whose
contribution to explaining CV|y drops further).
Our overall assessment is that CV|y projections
this year are more robust. The newly estimated
coefficients point to contributions of the
explanatory variables in predicting the CV|y in
the same direction as estimated before but the
same model now fits the data considerably better,
as captured by the increased r2 coefficient and
increased ratios between estimated coefficients
and standard errors, especially for real GDP per
capita and income Gini.
The series of CV|y values predicted by the
formula separately for each country for the years
T + 1 to 2030 is then calibrated to the value for
year T, similarly to what is done for the DES:

C. Methodology for the analysis of food
insecurity by degree of urbanization and
by gender
The prevalence of food insecurity can be
disaggregated by respondent/household
characteristics when the data are collected
directly from individual respondents in nationally
representative samples. In Chapter 2, food
insecurity estimates are presented disaggregated
by sex of the respondent (adult men or women)
and by Degree of Urbanization (DEGURBA)
(i.e. urban, peri-urban or rural residency).
The methodology to disaggregate the
indicator by any individual or household
characteristics is as follows:
 The cross-country comparable probability
of food insecurity for each respondent is
computed at two levels of severity: moderate
or severe, and severe only. The probabilities
are aggregated for each category of the
characteristic of interest, by computing the
weighted average (using sampling weights)
across all respondents in that category,
obtaining the prevalence of food insecurity
within that group (for example, among
female respondents).
 The prevalence of food insecurity in a given
category is weighted by the corresponding
population (for example, the number of
female adults in the country) to obtain
the subregional/regional/global estimate
(for example, the prevalence of food insecurity
in the female adult population in Northern
Africa), if reliable population data are available
and if there is sufficient geographical coverage
in terms of percentage of the population.
The computation of the prevalence of food
insecurity by sex is possible because data are
collected from individual respondents (adults
aged 15 years or older) by FAO via data collection
service providers (see Annex 1B). For countries
for which national government survey data are
used to calculate the prevalence estimates of
food insecurity (see Annex 1B), it is generally
not possible to disaggregate the indicator by
sex, as data are collected at the household
level. This year, for the first time, a protocol
was developed to address this issue. Thus, in
such cases, the same relative difference by sex
estimated based on data collected by FAO is
applied to the prevalence of food insecurity in the
total population based on national data. This is
an approximation, as the difference in the FAO
data applies to adult respondents, and not to the
whole population. However, the benefit is that the
| 198 |
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
statistics by sex are consistent in terms of levels
and trends with those of the overall population.
The entire series was revised in this edition
of the report resulting in minor updates to the
levels of the prevalence of food insecurity by sex
at the regional and global levels compared to
the 2022 edition.
The disaggregation by DEGURBA is possible for
the first time this year because Gallup© began to
georeference each interview in countries collected
using face-to-face mode in 2021. In 2022, countries
covered by telephone interviews were also
georeferenced, providing enough geographical
representation to produce subregional/regional/
global food insecurity estimates by DEGURBA.
Within each country, it is possible to link each
georeferenced observation to the DEGURBA
dataset, defining whether the observation
(respondent) is located in a city, town or rural
area, based on population density and size,
according to internationally comparable criteria
developed by EUROSTAT, ILO, FAO, OECD,
UN-Habitat and the World Bank and approved at
the 51st session of the UN Statistical Commission
in March 2020.20 The prevalence of food insecurity
is computed for each category of urbanization
and then aggregated at the subregional/
regional/global level using the 2020 updated
DEGURBA population distribution published by
EUROSTAT.21 For countries where official food
insecurity statistics are informed by national data,
the same approximation method described for the
disaggregation by sex is applied.
As no FIES data were collected by FAO in China
in 2022, and the data collected in 2021 were not
georeferenced, the estimates of food insecurity
by DEGURBA in China were approximated as
follows: the prevalence of food insecurity for
2021 was disaggregated by area of residence
as defined in the Gallup© World Poll, where
respondents report if they live in: a rural area or
on a farm; a small town or village; a large city or
the suburb of a large city. Then, these categories
were mapped to the DEGURBA by considering
people living in a rural area or on a farm as
part of the “rural” population, those living in a
small town or village as part of the “peri-urban”
population and those living in a large city and
in the suburb of a large city as “urban” residents.
This mapping was justified with the rationale
that DEGURBA classifies areas with increasing
urbanization based on population density and
size. To ensure that no significant bias was
induced by this approach, the same mapping
was validated as accurate for other Asian
countries where data were collected in 2022.
D. Methodology for the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet
FAO with support from the World Bank Data
Group systematically monitors the cost and
affordability of a healthy diet (CoAHD) indicators
and recently began to disseminate the updated
series on the FAOSTAT database.22 Estimates
are updated for 2021 (see sections below,
Updating the cost of a healthy diet and Updating
the affordability of a healthy diet). In addition,
periodic revisions of the entire data series are
carried out by FAO to continuously improve the
methodology and provide robust estimates on the
CoAHD indicators.
The cost of a healthy diet
The cost of a healthy diet is defined as the cost
of the least expensive locally available foods to
meet requirements for energy and food-based
dietary guidelines (FBDGs) for a representative
person within an energy balance of 2 330 kcal/
day. The FBDGs analysed explicitly recommend
food quantities for each food group and provide
a wide regional representation. Although it
is not selected based on nutrient content but
is determined by FBDGs, this diet meets on
average nearly 95 percent of nutrient needs, so
it can therefore almost always be considered as
nutrient adequate.
The availability and prices of items in each food
group needed for a healthy diet were obtained
from the World Bank-led ICP as national averages
for 2017. Item definitions are internationally
standardized, allowing classification by food
group and calculation of the least costs to reach
FBDG requirements in each country, representing
an average across markets and throughout the
year.19 The cost of a healthy diet indicator is
calculated using a standard basket, called the
Healthy Diet Basket, which consists of six food
groups and reflects the commonalities across
ten identified FBDGs. For a detailed description
| 199 |
ANNEX 2
of the healthy diet and related methodology, see
Herforth et al. (2020, 2022).23, 24
Affordability of a healthy diet
In this report, to determine affordability,
the cost of a healthy diet is compared with
country-specific income distributions that are
derived from the World Bank’s PIP.25 The resulting
measures of affordability include the percentage
and number of people unable to afford a healthy
diet in a given country, in 2021. A healthy diet is
considered unaffordable when its cost exceeds
52 percent of the income in a country. This
percentage accounts for a portion of income
that can be credibly reserved for food, based on
observations that the population in low-income
countries spend, on average, 52 percent of their
income on food, as derived from the 2017 ICP
national accounts household expenditure data.
Based on this threshold and comparing the cost
of the diet with country income distributions, we
obtain the percentage of people for whom the cost
of the diet is unaffordable. These proportions are
then multiplied by the 2021 population in each
country using the world development indicators
(WDI) of the World Bank,26 to obtain the number
of people unable to afford a healthy diet in a
given country. For a detailed description of the
affordability indicators and related methodology,
see Annex 3 of FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP
and WHO (2020).27
Updating the cost of a healthy diet
The ICP is currently the only source of retail food
price data for internationally standardized items,
as part of a larger effort to compute PPP exchange
rates across all countries of the world. However,
these data are only available once every three to
five years, which does not allow for yearly global
monitoring of diet costs to guide programmes
and policies. In the absence of updated food price
data, in this report, the method of updating the
cost indicator between ICP publication years
relies on consumer price indices (CPIs) published
by FAO. This dataset tracks change in monthly
general and food CPIs at the national level with
reference to a base year of 2015. The annual
CPIs are computed as simple averages of the
12 monthly CPIs within a year. In particular,
CPI data for food and non-alcoholic beverages
are used to update the cost of a healthy diet in
2021 for all countries except the Central African
Republic and Guyana, for which the general CPI
is used. The cost of a healthy diet is estimated for
the complete series (2018–2021) by multiplying
each country’s 2017 actual cost, expressed in local
currency units (LCU), with the CPI ratio and
finally dividing by purchasing power parities:
where t = 2018, ... , 2021 and

^.
Imputed Cost (PPP dollars)( = The cost of the healthy diet is first updated in
LCU and then converted into international dollars
using the WDI PPP for private consumption
conversion factors,28 to compare the cost across
countries and political entities. For a detailed
description of the methodology, see Bai et al.
(forthcoming).29
The cost of the healthy diet was computed for
169 countries and territories in 2017 and updated
for 2018–2021 for all of them except Anguilla,
Montserrat, and Taiwan Province of China
that have information neither on CPIs nor on
PPPs. Out of the remaining 166 countries and
territories, there are 24 countries with missing
PPP data in any year between 2018 and 2021,bg
and one territory with missing CPI data (Turks
and Caicos Islands). For the 24 countries, PPP
imputations were applied using an Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average with External
Explanatory Variable (ARIMAX) model. In line
with the World Bank’s WDI methodology for
PPP extrapolations, the ratio between a country’s
general CPI and the CPI for the base country (in
this case the United States of America) is included
in the model specification as a key predictor of
PPP values. Furthermore, per capita GDP and
per capita household consumption expenditure
are also added as external covariates, and the
Holt-Winter smoothing methodology is applied
to both the series to fill the gaps, if needed. The
ARIMAX approach allows to estimate, for each
bg The 24 countries and territories for which PPPs were imputed are
the following: Argentina, Aruba, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands,
Cayman Islands, Curaçao, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti,
Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Eswatini, Gabon, Kazakhstan, Liberia,
Malawi, Myanmar, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sint
Maarten (Dutch part), Suriname, Tajikistan, United Arab Emirates and
Zimbabwe.

country, several model specifications that include
an autoregressive component, an integration
component, a moving average, and a combination
of the three. The best specification is selected
when at least the estimated coefficient of the
CPI ratio is statistically significant, followed
by the statistical significance of the ARIMAX
parameters. For countries and territories showing
abnormal PPP series over time, the CPI ratio
is found to be the only statistically significant
coefficient to affect the variability of the PPP
values. On the contrary, for countries and
territories with a less volatile PPP series, the
historical PPP trend plays also a role in predicting
PPP values, as well as the coefficient estimates
of per capita GDP and/or per capita expenditure.
The ARIMAX computes the predicted values
on the best specification selected for each
country/territory.
For one territory with missing information on
CPIs (Turks and Caicos Islands), cost imputations
were applied using the average diet cost in the
corresponding subregion:

Subregional cost averages were computed
excluding the Turks and Caicos Islands.
A limitation of this method used to update the
cost of a healthy diet in 2018–2021 is that changes
in the cost depend on (food) CPIs and do not
reflect item-specific changes in food prices, nor
any differential changes in the price of different
food groups, due to the lack of new item-level
food price data for more nutritious food items.
FAO is exploring how to expand reporting of
item-level prices to allow more frequent and
robust monitoring of the cost of a healthy diet.
Updating the affordability of a healthy diet
In this report, affordability was updated for
the years 2018 to 2021. Of the 169 countries and
territories with cost information in 2017, the
affordability indicators were estimated for 143
with income distributions available in the PIP
database. This information was updated for all
countries and territories for 2018–2021, except
Taiwan Province of China for which food CPIs
are not available.
Through continuous updates based on incoming
national surveys and data imputations, the
income distributions in the PIP database25 are
now available and updated for the years 2020
and 2021 in many countries and territories. To
update affordability in these years, distributions
in the PIP database were used for 78 of the
142 countries/territories in 2020, and for 27 in
2021. For the remaining ones (64 in 2020; 115 in
2021), affordability was estimated by the PIP
team using projected distributions,30 obtained by
applying the World Bank’s standard methods for
nowcasting poverty.31 Finally, the proportion of
people unable to afford a healthy diet, estimated
using both methods, was multiplied by each
country/territory’s population using the WDI of
the World Bank, to obtain the number of people
who could not afford a healthy diet. The latest
estimates of the affordability indicators were
performed on 26 April 2023. As the PIP database
is currently undergoing continuous updates of
income distributions, affordability estimations
after this date may marginally change.
In this year’s edition, a revision of the
methodology involves the affordability data
series. Following the recent release of new PPP
for 2017, the World Bank adopted these latest
conversion factors to express its collection of
monetary indicators in 2017 PPP terms, including
income distributions in the PIP database.25 It
implies that the indicators of affordability are no
longer expressed in 2011 PPP as in previous years
but rather in 2017 PPP. Shifting the base year has
led to considerable variations in affordability
for certain countries. Nonetheless, this change
is associated with improvements in the quality
of PPPs and better reflects the current economic
situations worldwide.32 Specifically, for seven
countries, the share of people unable to afford
a healthy diet was at least 7 percentage points
lower in 2021 when expressed in 2017 PPP
instead of 2011 PPP (Angola, Plurinational State
of Bolivia, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Sao Tome and
Principe, and Suriname). Conversely, it was 14
and 7 percentage points higher in Ghana and
Belize, respectively. The World Bank has also
acknowledged large changes to the measure
of poverty rates for the same countries listed,
following the adoption of 2017 PPP. These
were carefully evaluated and found to reflect
improvements in the quality of the PPPs.32 In
| 201 |
ANNEX 2
some of these countries, the 2017 PPPs are based
on price data from a broader list of items than
in the 2011 PPP round; in other countries, price
data were collected for the first time in 2017,
overcoming the limitation of imputed PPPs prior
to this round. In the case of upper-middle-income
countries such as Ghana and Belize, the cost
thresholds have risen between 2011 and 2017, and
hence the share and number of the population
whose income falls below the thresholds (i.e. are
unable to afford a healthy diet) is larger.33
E. Methodology for the rural–urban
analysis of nutrition outcomes
A rural–urban analysis in Section 2.3 was carried
out according to urban and rural residence as
applied to four nutrition indicators using regional
estimates with their confidence intervals. The
analysis was performed across regions based on
data availability for countries within each region.
The weighted analysis was applied using the
latest available data from national surveys
between 2015 and 2021. The list of countries
contributing to each region is presented in
Table A2.3; data sources are included in table notes.
The regional urban and rural results presented
are based on a population-weighted analysis of
a subset of countries with disaggregated data
available by place of residence using the latest
available data from national surveys between
2015 and 2021 for exclusive breastfeeding and
between 2016 and 2022 for stunting, wasting
and overweight. The regional rural and
urban estimates are presented only when the
regional estimate by residence has a population
coverage of 50 percent or more by rural or urban
residence. Population coverage is calculated
by dividing the sum of the population of
children under five years for countries with at
least one data point from household surveys
within the specified year range by the total
population of children under five years for all
countries in the region.
F. Methodology for assessment of
progress against nutrition targets at the
regional and global levels
These methodological notes pertain to results
presented in Table 6 in Section 2.3 of the report
which depicts the regional and subregional
assessment of progress towards the 2030 nutrition
targets. Progress was assessed against the
2030 nutrition targets established by UNICEF/
WHO34 and an adapted version of rules from the
WHO-UNICEF Technical Expert Advisory Group
on Nutrition Monitoring35 for all indicators where
2030 targets or progress assessment rules have not
been established.
To determine which progress assessment
category to use for each indicator and each
region, first, two distinct average annual rates
of reduction (AARR)bh were calculated: i) the
AARR required for the region to reach the 2030
target; and ii) the actual AARR that the region
has experienced to date. The value of the actual
AARR experienced to date is then used to
determine which progress assessment category
the region is assigned, while also considering
the required AARR. See Table A2.4 for AARR
ranges and prevalence thresholds applied for
each category and for each indicator, briefly:
 On track: regions with an actual AARR that is
greater than the required AARR are categorized
as being “on track” (green) to achieve the target.
A static threshold for the latest prevalence,
as noted for each indicator in Table A2.4, is also
used to categorize regions as being “on track”;
for example, any region for which the most
recent overweight prevalence is below 3 percent
is considered “on track”, even if their actual
AARR is less than their required AARR.
 Off track: regions with an actual AARR
that is less than the required AARR and for
which the latest prevalence is above the “on
track” static threshold noted in Table A2.4 are
considered “off track”. The “off track” category
is broken down into different subcategories
depending on the indicator. For the indicators
of child stunting, child overweight and child
bh See technical note on how to calculate AARR at: https://data.

| 203 |
ANNEX 2
NOTES:
1. For low birthweight and exclusive breastfeeding, the categories of “off track – no progress” and “off track – worsening” are combined into one
category of “off track – no progress or worsening” because there is insufficient variation in current progress to split these categories for these indicators.
2. For exclusive breastfeeding, the actual target is to increase the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding (under six months) to 70 percent by 2030;
however, it has been revised here to reflect the prevalence of non-exclusive breastfeeding so that the concept of the AARR can be applied as it is for the
other six targets.
3. The required AARR is based on the change in stunting prevalence corresponding to a 50 percent reduction in the number of children affected by
stunting between 2012 and 2030, considering the population growth estimated by the United Nations World Population Prospects. Actual AARR is
calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2022.
4. Regions considered on track are those where the stunting prevalence point estimate or the lower 95 percent confidence interval for 2022 is below
3 percent.
5. The required AARR is based on the required change in overweight or wasting prevalence to reduce from the baseline (2012) prevalence to 3 percent by
2030. Actual AARR is calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2022. Note that for wasting, unpublished trend estimates from the JME are used to
generate the actual AARR.
6. Regions where the overweight or wasting prevalence point estimate for 2022 is below 3 percent are considered on track.
7. The required AARR is based on the change required to reduce the low birthweight prevalence by 30 percent between 2012 (baseline year) and 2030.
The same AARR of 1.96 is required for all regions since the target requires a relative change (reduction by 30 percent) in the baseline value. Actual AARR
is calculated using all years of data between 2012 and 2020.
8. Regions where the low birthweight prevalence point estimate for 2020 is below 5 percent are considered on track.
9. The required AARR is based on the required change to decrease the non-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence to 30 percent between 2012 (baseline
year) and 2030. Actual AARR is calculated using only two estimates for the years of 2012 and 2021, where the regional averages are population weighted
using the most recent estimate for each country between 2005 and 2012 for the 2012 estimate, and between 2016 to 2021 for the 2021 estimate.
10. Regions where the non-exclusive breastfeeding prevalence point estimate for 2021 is below 30 percent (i.e. where exclusive breastfeeding is
≥70 percent) are considered on track.
11. The global databases for the indicators of stunting, overweight and low birthweight are based on country-level models which provide annual estimates
for all countries for generation of regional and global estimates (i.e. annual estimates are even available for countries without any household survey data,
even in cases where country-modelled estimates are not released to the public and used only for generation of global and regional estimates), thus
making progress assessment possible for all regions.
12. Progress assessment against the child stunting and child overweight targets is not conducted for countries which did not have any input data (e.g.
household survey data) to use in the country model which were more recent than 2022, or for which modelled estimates remain pending final review.
13. Progress assessment is not possible for wasting for regions where population coverage is less than 50 percent. Population coverage is calculated by
dividing the sum of the population of children under five years for countries with at least one data point from household surveys between 1990 and 2020
by the total population of children under five years for all countries in the region. Since wasting estimates are generated with a subregional model, even
one year of data between 1990 and 2020 counts towards the regional population coverage.
14. Progress assessment against the child wasting target is not conducted for countries which do not have at least two data points (e.g. household
surveys) between 2005 and 2022, with at least one point being more recent than 2012.
15. Progress assessment is not possible for exclusive breastfeeding where the population coverage of country survey data for the region is less than
50 percent for the 2012 and/or the 2021 estimate. For 2012, population coverage is calculated by dividing the sum of the population of children under
five years for countries with at least one data point from household surveys between 2005 and 2012 by the total population of children under five years
for all countries in the region. For 2021, population coverage is calculated by dividing the sum of the population of children under five years for countries
with at least one data point from household surveys between 2016 and 2021.

wasting, there are three off track subcategories:
“off track – some progress” (yellow), “off track
– no progress” (light red) and “off track –
worsening” (dark red). For low birthweight
and exclusive breastfeeding, the categories
of “off track – no progress” (light red) and
“off track – worsening” (dark red) are combined
into one category of “off track – no progress
or worsening” which is represented with an
orange colour, because there is insufficient
variation in the progress to date to use the two
categories for these indicators.
 Assessment not possible: For the indicators
based on country-modelled data (child
stunting, child overweight, low birthweight),
an assessment is possible for all regions
because a modelled estimate exists for all
countries meaning there are enough data
to generate representative estimates for all
regions and for all years. For indicators where
country-modelled estimates are not available
(child wasting and exclusive breastfeeding),
assessment is not possible for regions where
population coverage is less than 50 percent
(see footnotes 16 and 17 to Table A2.4).
The years of data used to calculate the actual
AARR experienced to date at the regional level
vary by indicator as specified in the footnotes
for Table A2.4. The actual AARRs for each region
are calculated using a trend line comprising
all estimates available between 2012 (baseline)
and the latest estimate for each indicator,
except for exclusive breastfeeding for which
modelled estimates are not available and which
is calculated using only two estimates: the
baseline (2012) and the latest year available
(2019). The required AARR is calculated
using the baseline prevalence for the region
in 2012 and the target prevalence as noted in
the 2030 Maternal Infant and Young Child
Nutrition targets34 (e.g. for child overweight,
the required is AARR is 3.41 percent per year
at the global level, which is the annual rate of
change needed to go from the 2012 baseline
prevalence of 5.6 percent to the targeted
3.0 percent in 2030). n

The cost and affordability of a healthy diet, and
the change of these indicators from 2019 to 2021,
are reported in Table 5 by region, subregion and
country income group, following the World Bank
classification of countries by income level for
2022, based on per capita gross national income
in 2021. Income classification is provided for
all countries and territories except Anguilla
and Montserrat.
Cost and affordability are also reported at the
country level in Table A3.1 for the reference year
2017 when the ICP data were released, as well
as for 2018–2021 when the two indicators are
updated using the methodology described
in Annex 2, Section D. In 2018–2021, the
cost indicator was updated for 166 of the
169 countries and territories with information
available in 2017, while affordability was
updated for 142 of the 143 countries and
territories. For Argentina and Zimbabwe, cost
and affordability in 2018–2021 are used to
estimate aggregate indicators shown in Table 5
but are not reported in Table A3.1. To update

the costs in 2018–2021, PPP exchange rates
for both countries are imputed, but they may
not thoroughly reflect the severe currency
devaluation and/or economic instability that the
countries have experienced. Table A3.2 provides
ranges of the affordability indicators globally,
as well as by region, subregion and country
income group, which show the percentage and
number of people unable to afford a healthy diet
in 2021. Lower-bound estimates assume that
80 percent of income is allocated to food, as this
represents the largest expenditure share on food
observed in the ICP 2017 data (in Guinea-Bissau).
Upper-bound estimates assume that the share
of income reserved for food varies by country
income group. Following ICP 2017 national
accounts data, food expenditures represent, on
average, 14 percent, 27 percent, 38 percent and
52 percent of total expenditures in high-income
countries, upper-middle-income countries,
lower-middle-income countries and low-income
countries, respectively. For a full description
of the methodology used to determine these
ranges, see Herforth et al. (2020).23 n

NOTES: The table shows the cost and affordability of a healthy diet at the country level, as well as by region, subregion, and country income group in
2017–2021. For each region, subregion and country income group, the unaffordability estimated as the percentage of the population unable to afford a
healthy diet is population weighted. The 2022 World Bank classification of countries by income group is used for all years from 2017 to 2021 and for all
countries and territories except Anguilla and Montserrat, for which income classification is not provided.
n.a. = data not available. n.r. = data not reported because of insufficient or unreliable data to update cost and affordability. * Cost and affordability of a
healthy diet include Zimbabwe. ** Cost and affordability of a healthy diet include Argentina. a
 PPP was imputed in this year.

A. URCA data definitions and framework
The Urban Rural Catchment Areas (URCA) is a
publicly available global geospatial dataset which
provides a global mapping of the rural–urban
continuum.36, 37 It is based on the Global Human
Settlement Layer21 and places urban centres on
a gradient based on population size and density.
As shown in Chapter 3 (Figure A of Box 2) rural
locations are assigned a gradient of their own,
using the shortest travel time to urban centres of
various sizes. Thus, the URCA disaggregates rural
areas into multiple categories, distinguishing,
for example, between locations that are less than
1 hour from an urban centre and those that are
farther away. In Chapter 4, the URCA dataset is
combined with household survey data for the
country case studies.
The URCA approach builds upon the central
place theory, which is a set of assumptions and
propositions that explain why hierarchically
tiered centres are found at certain favoured
locations on the economic landscape. For
example, retail trade and service activities often
tend to cluster. The URCA approach assumes that
city size is a proxy for the breadth of services
and opportunities provided by an urban centre.
It uses travel time to locations as a proxy for
cost and adopts an urban hierarchy based on
city size to classify rural locations as gravitating
around a specific urban centre. This approach
allows for: i) capturing the urban hierarchy that
exists between urban centres of different sizes
in terms of access to services and employment
opportunities for rural locations; ii) defining
urban–rural catchment areas (URCAs) in terms
of the interconnection between urban centres
(of different sizes) and their surrounding rural
ANNEX 4
DATA AND DEFINITIONS
FOR CHAPTER 3
areas; and iii) adopting a gridded approach that
is easily comparable across countries, developing
a dataset for the whole world.
Additionally, the URCA approach allows for the
identification of the share of the population that
falls in a specific category of the rural–urban
continuum within an administrative unit, rather
than placing all the population in one territory
or functional area. This categorization allows for
more detailed analyses regarding consumption
and production across the continuum. Table A4.1
describes the basic urban URCA categories;
consequently, different categories of rural are
attributed to urban areas of different sizes,
e.g. rural areas less than 1 hour travel to a city of
more than 5 million people.
In defining the rural URCA categories based on
travel time to an urban agglomerations, the time
interval is to be considered as a closed interval on
the right. In particular, for the URCA categories
used in the report it means that:
 “<1 hour” to any urban centre includes areas
located 1 hour or less to a city of any size or
town: areas ≤1 hour.
 “1–2 hours” to any urban centre includes
areas located more than 1 hour but less or
equal to 2 hours to a city of any size or town:
1 hour < area ≤2 hours.
 “>2 hours” to any urban centre includes areas
located more than 2 hour to a city of any size or
town: areas >2 hours.
Note that for improved readability of the text and
figures in Chapter 4, this degree of specificity
applies, but is not written at this level of detail.

B. Methodological approach and tool for
the systematic structural literature review
The systematic review of evidence from scientific
studies used for Chapter 3, designed following the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-analysis (PRISMA),4 was implemented
using an integrated research tool, Expert Search
Semantic ENriChmEnt (Essence), developed by
the FAO Data Lab.
Essence is based on a web application that offers
the possibility of automatically querying scientific
articles from multiple data sources (Google
Scholar, World Bank, International Monetary
Fund, etc.). These articles, including their full text,
are then stored and made available for review
through a semantic search engine utilizing the
Apache Solr database at its core. This allows
for the aggregation and filtering of results by
selecting values automatically identified when
the documents are downloaded or by exploiting
annotations added collaboratively.
Advanced methods were used from the tool’s
web interface, which permitted the filtering of
downloaded documents through an algorithm
based on an artificial intelligence method that
learns and extends user selections of relevant
articles. The approach relies on the manual
revision of a small subset of documents that are
identified as relevant, or not, by the users to be
used as a source of ground truth. A preliminary
text pre-processing and learning step was then
executed directly from the web interface, in
order to estimate and generalize the linking
function between the content (i.e. terms) of
the reviewed documents and their relevance
status. The learning step was based on linear
logistic regression, which is a classification
algorithm used to solve binary classification
problems. The logistic regression classifier uses
a weighted combination of the input features
(the terms in the Tf-idf matrix) and passes them
through a sigmoid function that transforms
any real number input to a number between 0
and 1. The weights of the combinations are then
estimated to minimize the distance between
the output of the function and the user’s
specification of the relevance of the reviewed
documents. After this step, the resulting
function was applied to all the documents that
were downloaded (and also those not reviewed),
which were associated to a “score of relevance.”
A threshold made it possible to classify all
the documents that were downloaded and not
manually reviewed as “relevant”.
Through this iterative process, it was possible to
revise the literature in few passages and rely on
the features available directly from the Essence
Web interface. This is because the proposed
relevance score for the non-user-evaluated
documents becomes a filter, permitting users
to quickly identify and review the most likely
relevant documents and add new examples that
could help the algorithm to better identify those
that are relevant to the set of documents used
in the learning step. This iterative process helps
users filter out the most relevant documents
and helps improve the accuracy of the model so
that it is better able to make predictions on the
relevance of a document.
For a full description of the implementation of
the PRISMA protocol, and the methodological
approach for the systematic structural literature
review, see de Bruin and Holleman (2023).18 n

 TABLE A4.1 URCA DEFINITION OF CATEGORIES ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
| 215 |
A. Household surveys
The demand analysis conducted in Section 4.1
and the estimation of subnational cost of a healthy
diet in Section 4.2 use georeferenced data from
national representative LSMS surveys (Table A5.1).
The surveys capture apparent household food
consumption using quantitative seven-day recalls.
The same surveys contain a separate module
with eight questions regarding people’s access to
adequate food, which was used for the estimation
of the prevalence of moderate or severe food
insecurity in Section 4.2.
Finally, malnutrition indicators among children
under five years of age assessed in Section 4.2
were derived using georeferenced data from
national representative demographic and health
surveys (Table A5.1).
B. URCA categories used in the
rural–urban continuum analysis
For the analyses conducted in Chapter 4, the
URCA categories were simplified and grouped
into ten categories, with a further aggregation to
urban, peri-urban and rural categories (see Table 9
in Chapter 4). This aggregation allowed for a
sufficient number of observations in almost
ANNEX 5
DATA AND DEFINITIONS
FOR CHAPTER 4
all URCAs to conduct the analyses. For more
details on the URCA categories, see Box 2 and Box 3
in Chapter 3. Table A5.2 reports the number of
households interviewed in each URCA and the
number of households for which georeferenced
variables were not available, and for which it was
thus not possible to assign to any URCA.
The surveys are all nationally representative,
but they are not meant to be representative at
the URCA level. For this reason, the distribution
of population surveyed across URCAs was
compared with the actual population distribution
(estimated based on the 2020 Global Human
Settlement Population [GHS-POP] dataset and the
URCA dataset), and it was found to be sufficiently
similar so as to exclude that any catchment area
was under- or overrepresented in each survey.
The URCA dataset was developed based on
i) the GHS Settlement Model (GHS-SMOD) grid
to identify cities and towns; ii) the GHS-POP
grid for 2015 to calculate the urban population
in each city; and iii) travel time classifications
based on Nelson et al. (2019)38 with updated cost
surface from Weiss et al. (2020).39 Accordingly, the
matching between the URCA dataset and surveys
in Table A5.1 presents some time inconsistencies,
ANNEX 5
| 216 |
as surveys are for a one-year period and were
conducted between 2018 and 2019 (except Malawi,
conducted between 2019 and 2020). However, the
information on road and infrastructure used in
the URCA dataset was the most updated at the
time the dataset was developed, which is around
the same time the surveys were conducted.
Thus, we expect that the travel time in the URCA
dataset does not diverge significantly from
the travel time faced by the households in the
surveys analysed.
To identify the urban centres in the URCA
dataset, the 2015 GHS-POP was used. Accordingly,
it is possible that some peri-urban areas are
misclassified in the analysis of Chapter 4 (i.e. if
a city has expanded, some areas that were in
2015 classified as “less than 1 hour from the
city” could have become part of the city in
2018/19). This is however only the case if the
city had expanded geographically and not just
in population size. In addition, it is possible that
an urban centre may have grown in population
size between 2015 and 2018/19 and made the
jump from small to intermediate city, or from
intermediate to large city.
C. Food processing and food group
aggregates used in food demand analyses
Explanatory note on processed foods and food
processing classification systems
The term “food processing” involves applying
scientific and technological principles to
preserve foods by slowing down or stopping the
natural processes of decay.40 Purposes of food
processing include converting inedible into edible
foods, increasing the digestibility of raw foods
(e.g. through cooking), altering the shelf-life
(e.g. through fermentation, canning or freezing),
simplifying meal preparation, or increasing
the palatability of food products (e.g. through
the addition of flavourings). The degree of
food processing can vary from unprocessed
raw foods (e.g. fresh fruit eaten as such) to
food products whose ingredients are derived
from food but contain little or no whole food
(e.g. extruded cereals).41 Certain food processing

methods can help to increase food availability
by allowing transport of foods across the globe,
thus extending seasonal availability beyond
what is produced locally in a specific season,
and also making food safer to eat.42 Foods and
food products processed in industrial settings
differ from those prepared by hand at home
or in artisanal settings; they employ different
ingredients and methods.41
During the last two decades, numerous
classification systems, taking into account
various degrees of food processing, have been
developed. Among them are food classification
systems that emphasize industrial food
processing, whereby foods are categorized
according to processing-related criteria,
each employing different criteria and metrics.
They have been used to describe and monitor
levels of consumption of different types of
processed foods, their impact on overall diet
quality and disease outcomes (in several
countries), the places where these foods are
purchased, or their availability in urban food
environments in particular.41, 43
The NOVA food classification is one of the
available food processing classification systems
that has been considered in different scenarios
for public health, nutrition and epidemiological
research. However, there are important
limitations in this classification. The definition
of levels of food processing, as proposed by
NOVA, is complex and multidimensional, which
increases the risk of misclassification of food
items.43 In addition, the first category combines
unprocessed and minimally processed foods,
which makes it difficult to unambiguously
interpret the findings. It has been suggested that
there may be few advantages from using the

 TABLE A5.3 NOVA FOOD GROUPS WITH DESCRIPTIONS AND EXAMPLES
NOVA food group Description Examples
1. Unprocessed and
minimally processed
foods
Unprocessed foods are of plant origin (leaves, stems, roots,
tubers, fruits, nuts, seeds), or animal origin (meat, other
flesh, tissue and organs, eggs, milk), consumed shortly after
harvesting, gathering, slaughter or husbanding. Minimally
processed foods are unprocessed foods altered in ways that
do not add or introduce any substance, but that may involve
subtracting parts of the food. Minimal processes include
cleaning, scrubbing, washing; winnowing, hulling, peeling,
grinding, grating, squeezing, flaking; skinning, boning,
carving, portioning, scaling, filleting; pressing; drying,
skimming, fat reduction; pasteurizing, sterilizing; chilling,
refrigerating, freezing; sealing, bottling (as such); simple
wrapping, vacuum- and gas-packing. Malting, which adds
water, is a minimal process, as is fermenting, which adds
living organisms, when it does not generate alcohol.
The main aim of these processes is to extend the life of
unprocessed foods, enabling their storage for longer use,
or to make them edible, and, often, to make their
preparation easier or more diverse.
Fresh, chilled, frozen, vacuum-packed
vegetables and fruits; grains (cereals)
including all types of rice; fresh, frozen and
dried beans and other legumes (pulses),
roots and tubers; fungi; dried fruits and
freshly prepared or pasteurized nonreconstituted fruit juices; unsalted nuts and
seeds; fresh, dried, chilled, frozen meats,
poultry, fish, seafood; dried, fresh,
pasteurized full-fat, low-fat, skimmed milk,
fermented milk such as plain yoghurt; eggs;
flours, “raw” pastas made from flour and
water, teas, coffee, herb infusions; tap,
filtered, spring, mineral water. Also includes
foods made from two or more items in this
group, such as dried mixed fruits, granola
made from cereals, nuts and dried fruits
with no added sugars, honey or oils; pasta,
couscous and polenta made with flours,
flakes or grits and water; and foods with
vitamins and minerals added generally to
replace nutrients lost during processing,
such as wheat or cornflour fortified with
iron and folic acid.
2. Processed culinary
ingredients
Processed culinary ingredients are food products extracted
and purified by industry from constituents of foods, or else
obtained from nature, such as salt. Stabilizing or “purifying”
agents and other additives may also be used. They may
contain additives that prolong product duration, protect
original properties or prevent proliferation of
microorganisms.
Vegetable oils crushed from seeds, nuts or
fruits (notably olives); butter and lard
obtained from milk and pork; sugar and
molasses obtained from cane or beet;
honey extracted from combs and syrup
from maple trees; starches extracted from
corn and other plants, and salt mined or
from seawater, vegetable oils with added
antioxidants, and table salt with added
drying agents. Includes products consisting
of two group 2 items, such as salted butter,
and group 2 items with added vitamins or
minerals, such as iodized salt.
3. Processed foods These foods are manufactured by adding salt or sugars
(or other substance of culinary use such as oils or vinegar) to
whole foods, to make them more durable and sometimes
also to modify their palatability. They are directly derived
from foods and recognizable as versions of the original
foods. They are generally produced to be consumed as part
of meals or dishes, or may be used, together with highly
processed products, to replace food-based freshly prepared
dishes and meals. Processes include canning and bottling
using oils, sugars or salt, and methods of preservation such
as salting, salt pickling, smoking, curing. Processes and
ingredients here are designed to increase the durability of
group 1 foods and make them more enjoyable by modifying
or enhancing their sensory qualities. They may contain
additives that prolong product duration, protect original
properties, or prevent proliferation of microorganisms. When
alcoholic drinks are identified as foods, those produced by
fermentation of group 1 foods such as beer, cider and wine,
are classified here in group 3.
Canned or bottled vegetables and legumes
(pulses) preserved in brine; peeled or sliced
fruits preserved in syrup; tinned whole or
pieces of fish preserved in oil; salted nuts;
un-reconstituted processed meat and fish
such as ham, bacon, smoked fish; cheese;
and fresh unpackaged breads when made
from wheat flour (or other cereal flours),
water, ferments and salt.

NOVA classification compared with the current
epidemiologic approach, which relies on the
linkage of nutrient intakes to chronic disease,
with subsequent identification of foods that
merit consideration in public health nutrition
strategies.44 Therefore, results presented in
Chapter 4 should be interpreted with these
limitations and considerations in mind.
Food processing and food group classifications
used in Section 4.1
The NOVA classification system was developed
by researchers from the University of São Paulo,
Brazil.45 The system was published more than
ten years ago and has been used in different
settings and populations since.46 For the food
demand analyses by level of food processing, a
food classification system adapted from NOVA
was used, whereby all foods were classified
according to the nature, extent and purpose
of the industrial processing they undergo.
These processes involve physical, biological
and/or chemical methods used during the food
manufacturing process.41, 45
According to the NOVA classification, methods used
in households and similar places such as restaurants
or artisanal settings where fresh culinary
preparations are prepared from scratch by hand or
with simple tools, are by definition not industrial
processing methods. Home-prepared and artisanal
preparations of all types should as far as possible
be disaggregated into their components so that each
can then be classified into one of the four groups.
NOVA classifies all food items into four main
groups: 1) unprocessed and minimally processed
foods; 2) processed culinary ingredients;
3) processed foods; and 4) highly processed
foods and drink products.45, 46 The four main
NOVA food group Description Examples
4. Ultra-processed
foods and drink
products
These products are formulated mostly or entirely from
substances derived from foods or other organic sources,
and typically contain little or no whole foods. They are
durable, convenient, accessible, highly or ultra-palatable,
and often habit-forming. These foods are typically not
recognizable as versions of foods, although may imitate the
appearance, shape and sensory qualities of foods. Many
ingredients are not available in retail outlets. Some
ingredients are directly derived from foods, such as oils,
fats, flours, starches and sugars; others are obtained by
further processing of food constituents or synthesized from
other organic sources. Numerically the majority of
ingredients are preservatives; stabilizers, emulsifiers,
solvents, binders, bulkers; sweeteners, sensory enhancers,
colours and flavours; processing aids and other additives;
bulk may come from added air or water. Micronutrients may
“fortify” the products. Most are designed to be consumed
by themselves or in combination as snacks. Processes
include hydrogenation, hydrolysis; extruding, moulding,
re-shaping; pre-processing by frying, baking. Processes and
ingredients used to manufacture highly processed foods are
designed to create highly profitable products (low-cost
ingredients, long shelf-life, emphatic branding),
convenience (ready-to-consume) hyper-palatable products
liable to displace freshly prepared dishes and meals made
from all other NOVA food groups. When alcoholic drinks are
identified as foods, those produced by fermentation of
group 1 foods followed by distillation of the resulting
alcohol, such as whisky, gin, rum, vodka, are classified here
in group 4.
Chips (crisps), many types of sweet, fatty or
salty snack products; ice cream,
chocolates, candies (confectionery);
French fries (chips), burgers and hot dogs;
poultry and fish “nuggets” or “sticks”
(“fingers”); mass manufactured breads,
buns, cookies (biscuits); breakfast cereals;
pastries, cakes, cake mixes; “energy” bars;
preserves (jams); margarines; desserts;
canned, bottled, dehydrated, packaged
soups, noodles; sauces; meat, yeast
extracts; soft, carbonated, cola, “energy”
drinks; sugared, sweetened milk drinks,
condensed milk, sweetened including
“fruit” yoghurts; fruit and “fruit nectar”
drinks; instant coffee, cocoa drinks;
no-alcohol wine or beer; pre-prepared
meat, fish, vegetable, cheese, pizza, pasta
dishes; infant formulas, follow-on milks,
other baby products; “health”, “slimming”
products such as powdered or “fortified”
meal and dish substitutes.

groups and their descriptions are given in
Table A5.3. For the analysis in Section 4.1, food
items were classified according to the four
NOVA groups;45, 46 but for the purposes of
presentation, these were reduced to three
groups, with groups 2 and 3 combined as one
group. The three main groups (with food item
examples in each) and the names used in this
report are shown in Table A5.4.
For the purpose of the analysis in Section 4.1, the
FAO/WHO Global Individual Food consumption
data Tool (GIFT) food grouping (Table A5.5)47 was
adapted to form eight food groups as shown
in Table A5.6. For simplicity of presentation, a
number of the food groups were combined into
broader groups. For instance, the group “staple
foods” includes the subgroups “cereals and
their products” and “roots, tubers, plantains
and their products”. The group “animal source
foods” is composed of the subgroups “milk
and milk products”, “eggs and their products”,
“fish, shellfish and their products”, “meat and
meat products” and “insects, grubs and their
products” and so forth. The group “sweets,
condiments and beverages” is composed of the
subgroups “sweets and sugars”, “spices and
condiments” and “beverages”. “Food away from
home” comprises prepared foods consumed
away from home, which is specifically identified
in household surveys. Table A5.6 shows the food
group aggregates used in Section 4.1, along with
their food group names which are simplified for
presentation purposes in figures and tables.

D. Data and methodology behind analysis
in Box 6
The analysis of moderate or severe food insecurity
based on the FIES across the rural–urban
continuum (URCA) is based on data collected
by IFAD between 2019 and 2021 on small-scale
producer households and communities including
beneficiaries as well as non-beneficiaries (that
are used as counterfactual groups) in ex post
rural project impact assessments.bi The data
are comprehensive household-level data with
detailed GPS coordinates collected from 21 rural
development projects implemented in countries
from most regions of the world.
The projects are selected for impact assessments
to be representative of IFAD’s overall project
portfolio. Sample sizes range between 1 500
and 3 000 households and around 150 to 300
communities per project. They consist of detailed
information related to sociodemographic,
economic, and social capital variables, including
information on household dietary diversity and
food insecurity experiences as captured by the
bi Data from IFAD’s Impact Assessment (2019–2021) are collected
using the CAPI approach with Survey Solutions and cover
sociodemographic, economic, and social capital variables, as well as a
large set of variables that determine agricultural and non-agricultural
production and incomes. More information about these datasets can be
found on the following webpage: www.ifad.org/ifad-impact-assessmentreport-2021/index.html
FIES,48 which were available for 21 countries.bj The
FIES survey module was used, composed of eight
questions about respondents’ experiences facing
constrained access to food during the 12 months
preceding data collection. Respondents were
classified into three categories: 1) food secure or
only mildly food insecure; 2) moderately food
insecure; and 3) severely food insecure, following
standard methodology.49 n

Tables A7.1 to A7.5 present the econometric
results showing the marginal effectsbk of the
determinants of the different food consumption
shares of total food consumption (at market
value) for: i) consumption shares of purchased
food, for home consumption and food away from
home (Table A7.1); ii) consumption shares of highly
processed foods (Table A7.2); iii) consumption shares
of animal source foods (Table A7.3); iv) consumption
shares of food away from home (Table A7.4); and
v) consumption shares of vegetables (Table A7.5).
Only statistically significant marginal effects
(at 10 percent or lower) are presented. The effect
of location across the rural–urban continuum is
captured by the ten URCA categories defined
bk Marginal effects are partial derivatives of the regression equation
with respect to each variable in the model for each unit in the data;
average marginal effects are simply the mean of these unit-specific
partial derivatives over some sample. In ordinary least squares
regression with no interactions or higher-order term, the estimated
slope coefficients are marginal effects.50 Marginal effects tell us how a
dependent variable (outcome) changes when a specific independent
variable (explanatory variable) changes. Other covariates are assumed
to be held constant. Marginal effects are often calculated when
analysing regression analysis results.51
in Section 4.1, with the omission of the town
category to serve as a reference category to which
the other URCA variables are compared, i.e. the
marginal effect of the “large city” category is
interpreted as relative to the omitted URCA
town variable. The marginal effect of prices and
home assets is not shown (see source for full
presentation of results). Countries included in
the analysis: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire,
Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Malawi, Mali, Niger,
Nigeria, Senegal and Togo. All surveys are
2018/19, except Malawi (2019/20).

The cost and affordability of a healthy diet in
selected countries in Africa were estimated across
URCAs applying the FAO Healthy Diet Basket
(HDB) methodology, which comprises six food
groups.bl However, results are not comparable
with the global CoAHD indicators presented in
Chapter 2 (see Box A8.1). Food prices and income
distributions were obtained from 11 household
consumption and expenditure surveys conducted
between 2018 and 2019 (Table A5.1).
The analysis took place in four stages. In the
first stage, the household consumption and
expenditure survey data were georeferenced
using the URCA dataset. In the second stage, the
prices of food items were derived from household
food expenditure modules reporting the quantity
bought and amount spent by households based
on seven-day recall.bm Values were reported for
specific food items, thus allowing for computing
of the revealed price (i.e. the unit cost) by food
item. The price for each food item was obtained as
bl For information on the HDB data and methodology and the HDB
content by food group in terms of kcal, see FAO (2023).53
bm Expenditures were collected across different months, thus the
effect of seasonality on the price level is averaged out. The least-cost
items chosen for the HDB are therefore the least-cost items during
the year.

DIET USING HOUSEHOLD SURVEY
DATA FOR SELECTED COUNTRIES IN
AFRICA IN CHAPTER 4
a geometric meanbn of the revealed prices in each
URCA of each country. Note that food items not
reported in a specific spatial unit were considered
as not available in that area.
In the third stage, the food items for the
subnational (i.e. at the URCA level) HDB were
selected. The HDB composition was fixed in
terms of daily caloric contribution of the six
food groups, as per the HDB of the global
CoAHD monitoring indicators, but the specific
food items in the HDB were allowed to change
across URCAs. More specifically, the least-cost
item in each food group was selected in each
URCA for each country. In this way, the
composition of the HDB accounts for spatial
variation in terms of prices and availability,
as well as reflects items consumed by the
population in each URCA.bo To compute the
bn Geometric mean was chosen because of the high fluctuation in the
distribution of the unit costs of a food item across households in a
specific URCA. Notice that high fluctuations for the same food item are
not necessarily due to high volatility of market prices; rather, unit cost
reflects price, quantity, and quality of a food item. In household surveys,
items are not standardized as in the price data collection run by
government, thus the quality and variety of a food item purchased likely
change across households, reflecting access, availability and
preferences.
bo For example, pork is selected as one of the two items in the animal
source foods group in intermediate and small cities in Nigeria, but it is
not in the baskets of peri-urban areas (<1 hour away) where “cheese
(wara)” was picked.

cost of an item needed to meet the HDB caloric
requirement, prices (as described above) and
the nutrient conversion table developed for each
survey (based mainly on the FAO/INFOODS
Food Composition Table for Western Africa
[2019]) were used.
In the final stage, the measure of affordability
of a healthy diet was obtained by comparing
the daily cost of the HDB with the daily per
capita household income available for food.
Total household expenditure, including value
for own production, was used as a proxy for
income. The share of expenditure that can be
credibly reserved for food was set equal to the
average food expenditure share of households
belonging to the lowest quintile of the income
distribution of each URCA. The choice i) aligns
with the global CoAHD indicator methodology
where the average food expenditure share of
low-income countries is adopted, and ii) takes
into account different levels of economic
development across the rural–urban continuum.
When summary results are presented, averages
across the rural–urban continuum URCA-defined
categories are population weighted averages,
while average across countries are simple
averages, following the methodology used in
Chapter 2 for the calculation of regional CoAHD. n
 BOX A8.1 METHODOLOGY – GLOBAL AND SUBNATIONAL ESTIMATION OF THE COAHD
The estimation of the global monitoring indicator of
the cost and affordability of a healthy diet (CoAHD)
(Chapter 2) and the subnational estimation by
URCA in Section 4.2 follow the same methodology.
However, results are not comparable for three
main reasons:
 Food item prices. In the global monitoring, prices
from the World Bank International Comparison
Program (ICP) are used, whereas prices used in the
analysis presented in Chapter 4 are computed from
household surveys.
 Income distribution. In the global monitoring, the
affordability indicator is computed using the
estimated income distribution in a given country
from the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality
Platform (PIP); whereas total household expenditure
used in the analysis presented in Chapter 4 is
computed from household survey data to estimate
its distribution as a proxy for income distribution.
 Percentage of income that can be credibly reserved
for food. In the global monitoring, this percentage
is set equal to 52 percent – that is, the average
percentage of income spent on food in low-income
countries based on the national account
expenditure data from the World Bank ICP. In
the analysis of Chapter 4, on the other hand, the
average food expenditure shares of households
belonging to the lowest expenditure quintile in each
URCA are applied.

Acute food insecurity
Food insecurity found in a specified area at
a specific point in time and of a severity that
threatens lives or livelihoods, or both, regardless
of the causes, context or duration. Has relevance
in providing strategic guidance to actions that
focus on short-term objectives to prevent, mitigate
or decrease severe food insecurity.54
Affordability
Affordability refers to the ability of people to buy
foods in their local environment. In this report,
cost refers to what people have to pay to secure
a healthy diet, while affordability refers to the
cost relative to a person’s income, minus other
required expenses. In Section 2.2, affordability
is determined by comparing the cost of a healthy
diet with income distributions available in
the Poverty and Inequality Platform (PIP) of
the World Bank. This allows to compute the
percentage and number of people in each country
who are not able to afford a healthy diet.bp
Agrifood systems
Agrifood systems, a term increasingly used in
the context of transforming food systems for
sustainability and inclusivity, are broader as they
encompass both agricultural and food systems
and focus on both food and non-food agricultural
products, with clear overlaps. Agrifood systems
encompass the entire range of actors and their
interlinked value-adding activities involved in the
production, aggregation, processing, distribution,
consumption and disposal of food products. They
comprise all food products that originate from
crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries
and aquaculture, as well as the broader economic,
societal and natural environments in which these
diverse production systems are embedded.
Animal source foods
All types of meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, insects,
grubs, eggs, milk, cheese, yoghurt and other
milk products.47, 55
Catchment areas
In this report, catchment areas refer to rural
locations that gravitate around a specific urban
centre in terms of access to markets, services
and employment opportunities. The concept is
bp See Annex 2, Section D for the full description of the methodology.
ANNEX 11
GLOSSARY
based on the Central Place Theory (CPT),56 which
incorporates the functional interdependence
between a central place (i.e. a town or an urban
centre) and its surrounding rural area along
with the hierarchical level of the central place’s
goods and services.36
Climate
Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as
the average weather, or more rigorously, as the
statistical description in terms of the mean and
variability of relevant quantities over a period
of time ranging from months to thousands or
millions of years.57
Climate change
Climate change refers to a change in the state
of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by
using statistical tests) by changes in the mean
and/or the variability of its properties, and
that persists for an extended period, typically
decades or longer.57
Climate extreme (extreme weather or climate event)
The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near
the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed
values of the variable. For simplicity, both extreme
weather events and extreme climate events are
referred to collectively as “climate extremes”.58
Climate shocks
Climate shocks include not only those
disturbances in the usual pattern of rainfall
and temperatures but also complex events like
droughts and floods. Equivalent to the concept
of a natural hazard or stress, they are exogenous
events that can have a negative impact on
food security and nutrition, depending on the
vulnerability of an individual, a household, a
community, or systems to the shock.59, 60, 61, 62
Climate variability
Refers to variations in the mean state and other
statistics (standard deviations, the occurrence
of extremes, etc.) of the climate on all spatial
and temporal scales beyond that of individual
weather events. Variability may be due to
natural internal processes within the climate
system (internal variability), or to variations
in natural or anthropogenic external forcing
(external variability).57

Conflict
Conflict as used in this report is defined as
struggles between interdependent groups that
have either actual or perceived incompatibilities
with respect to needs, values, goals, resources or
intentions. This definition includes (but is broader
than) armed conflict – that is, organized collective
violent confrontations between at least two
groups, either state or non-state actors.
Diet quality
Comprised of four key aspects: variety
and/or diversity (within and across food groups),
adequacy (sufficiency of nutrients or food groups
compared to requirements), moderation (foods
and nutrients that should be consumed with
restraint) and overall balance (composition of
macronutrient intake). Exposure to food safety
hazards is another important quality aspect.
Dietary energy requirements
The amount of dietary energy, measured in
kilojoules or kilocalories (often referred to as
calories), required by an individual to maintain
body functions, health and normal activity.
Dietary energy requirements are dependent
upon age, sex, body size and level of physical
activity. Additional energy is required to support
optimal growth and development in children
and in women during pregnancy, and for
milk production during lactation, consistent
with the good health of mother and child.
Downstream food supply chains
Downstream food supply chains involve those
segments more directly related to consumer
purchases, that is marketing, retail and trade.
Drought
A period of abnormally dry weather lasting long
enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance.57
Economic downturn
Refers to a period of decline in economic activity
or negative growth as measured by the growth
rate in real GDP. It is a synonym for economic
recession, a temporary or short-term downturn
in economic growth, usually occurring over at
least two consecutive quarters of decline. In the
analyses and figures presented in this report, an
economic downturn is identified using the year as
a period of reference.
Economic shock
An unexpected or unpredictable event that is
external to the specific economy and can either
harm or boost it. A global financial crisis causing
bank lending or credit to fall, or an economic
downturn in a major trading partner of a country
reflect demand-side shocks that can have multiple
effects on spending and investment. A steep
rise in oil and gas prices, natural disasters that
result in sharp falls in production, or conflict that
disrupts trade and production, are examples of
supply-side shocks.
Economic slowdown
Refers to economic activity that is growing at a
slower pace compared with the previous period.
An economic slowdown occurs when real GDP
growth declines from one period to another,
but it is still positive. In the analyses and figures
presented in this report, an economic slowdown
is identified using the year as the period of
reference, although it is usually measured in
quarters of a year.
Energy-dense foods
Food with a high content of calories (energy) with
respect to its mass or volume.
Extreme poverty
Refers to the percentage of people living on less
than USD 2.15 a day (2017 PPP prices) in a country
in a given year.33
Extreme weather or climate event
The occurrence of a value of a weather or climate
variable above (or below) a threshold value near
the upper (or lower) ends of the range of observed
values of the variable. Many weather and climate
extremes are the result of natural climate
variability, and natural decadal or multi-decadal
variations in the climate provide the backdrop
for anthropogenic climate changes. Even if there
were no anthropogenic changes in climate, a wide
variety of natural weather and climate extremes
would still occur.
Fiscal subsidies
Fiscal subsidies are budget transfers made by
governments in the context of policy measures,
projects and programmes to individual actors of
the food and agriculture sector, such as farmers
(fiscal subsidies to producers) or consumers
ANNEX 11
| 246 |
(fiscal subsidies to consumers). Fiscal subsidies
to producers aim to reduce production costs
or increase farm income and can be granted
depending on output, input use or use of
other factors of production. Fiscal subsidies
to consumers include transfers under social
protection programmes (given to final consumers)
and food subsidies to lower the cost of food
(provided to intermediaries such as processors,
traders, transporters).
Flood
The overflowing of the normal confines of a stream
or other body of water, or the accumulation of
water over areas not normally submerged. Floods
include river (fluvial) floods, flash floods, urban
floods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods
and glacial lake outburst floods.57
Food and agricultural marketing
This includes collective schemes for
post-production facilities and other services
designed to improve the marketing environment
for food and agriculture – it includes all the stages
of a product value chain, from farm input supply
to retail markets. For example, these services may
include commodity grading schemes or agricultural
machinery services. They may be services related
to post-harvest losses, lower transaction costs,
facilitating market exchange and trade, and
strengthening or expanding supply networks.
Food away from home
Food away from home includes all meals
(breakfast and brunch, lunch, dinner and snacks
and non-alcoholic beverages) – including fast
food, takeouts and deliveries – consumed at
concession stands, buffets and cafeterias, and
full-service restaurants, and meals purchased at
vending machines or from mobile vendors. Also
included are board (including at school); meals as
pay; special catered events, such as weddings, bar
mitzvahs and confirmations; school lunches; and
meals away from home on trips.bq
bq Please see Annex 5, Section C for the definition of food away from
home used in the analysis presented in Chapter 4.
Food environment
The food environment is the physical, economic,
political and sociocultural context in which
consumers engage with agrifood systems to
make decisions about acquiring, preparing and
consuming food.63
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
An experience-based food security scale used to
produce a measure of access to food at different
levels of severity that can be compared across
contexts. It relies on data obtained by asking
people, directly in surveys, about the occurrence
of conditions and behaviours that are known to
reflect constrained access to food.
Food security
A situation that exists when all people, at all
times, have physical, social and economic access
to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets
their dietary needs and food preferences for an
active and healthy life. Based on this definition,
four food security dimensions can be identified:
food availability, economic and physical access to
food, food utilization and stability over time. The
concept of food security is evolving to recognize
the centrality of agency and sustainability.
See below for the definition of these two
additional elements.
Food security dimensions
In this report, food security dimensions refer to
the four traditional dimensions of food security:
a. Availability – This dimension addresses
whether or not food is actually or potentially
physically present, including aspects of
production, food reserves, markets and
transportation, and wild foods.
b. Access – If food is actually or potentially
physically present, the next question is
whether or not households and individuals
have sufficient physical and economic
access to that food.
c. Utilization – If food is available and households
have adequate access to it, the next question
is whether or not households are maximizing
the consumption of adequate nutrition and
energy. Sufficient energy and nutrient intake
by individuals is the result of good care and
feeding practices, food preparation, dietary
diversity and intra-household distribution of
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
| 247 |
food, and access to clean water, sanitation and
healthcare. Combined with good biological
utilization of food consumed, this determines
the nutritional status of individuals.
d. Stability – If the dimensions of availability,
access and utilization are sufficiently met,
stability is the condition in which the whole
system is stable, thus ensuring that households
are food secure at all times. Stability issues
can refer to short-term instability (which can
lead to acute food insecurity) or mediumto long-term instability (which can lead to
chronic food insecurity). Climatic, economic,
social and political factors can all be a source
of instability.
The report also refers to two additional
dimensions of food security that are proposed
by the High Level Panel of Experts (HLPE) of
the Committee on World Food Security (CFS);
however, they are not formally agreed upon
by FAO or others, and there is not a negotiated
agreed upon language. However, due to their
relevance in the context of this report, they are
included here. These two additional dimensions
of food security are reinforced in conceptual and
legal understandings of the right to food and are
currently referred to and defined as follows:
e. Agency refers to the capacity of individuals
or groups to make their own decisions about
what foods they eat; what foods they produce;
how that food is produced, processed and
distributed within food systems; and their
ability to engage in processes that shape food
system policies and governance.64
f. Sustainability refers to the long-term ability
of food systems to provide food security and
nutrition in a way that does not compromise
the economic, social and environmental bases
that generate food security and nutrition for
future generations.64
General services support (GSS)
Refers to public expenditure (or budget transfers)
for the provision of public or collective goods
and services that aim to create enabling and
environmentally sustainable conditions for
the food and agriculture sector. These services
connect all economic actors of food supply
chains and support the nexus between producers
and consumers. The most common include
research and development and knowledge
transfer, inspection services, agricultural related
infrastructure, public stockholding, and food and
agricultural marketing, and promotion.
Governance 
Governance refers to formal and informal rules,
organizations, and processes through which
public and private actors articulate their interests
and make and implement decisions.65
Hazard
A process, phenomenon or human activity that
may cause loss of life, injury or other health
impacts, property damage, social and economic
disruption or environmental degradation.66
Healthcare
The organized provision of medical care to
individuals or a community. This includes
services provided to individuals or communities
by health service providers for the purpose
of promoting, maintaining, monitoring or
restoring health.
Healthy diets
Healthy diets: 1) start early in life with
early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive
breastfeeding until six months of age, and
continued breastfeeding until two years of
age and beyond combined with appropriate
complementary feeding; 2) are based on a great
variety of unprocessed or minimally processed
foods, balanced across food groups, while
restricting highly processed food and drink
products; 3) include wholegrains, legumes, nuts
and an abundance and variety of fruits and
vegetables; 4) can include moderate amounts of
eggs, dairy, poultry and fish, and small amounts
of red meat; 5) include safe and clean drinking
water as the fluid of choice; 6) are adequate
(i.e. reaching but not exceeding needs) in energy
and nutrients for growth and development and
meet the needs for an active and healthy life
across the life cycle; 7) are consistent with WHO
guidelines to reduce the risk of diet-related
non-communicable diseases and ensure health
and well-being for the general population; and
8) contain minimal levels or none, if possible, of
pathogens, toxins and other agents that can cause
foodborne disease. According to WHO, healthy
diets include less than 30 percent of total energy
ANNEX 11
| 248 |
intake from fats, with a shift in fat consumption
away from saturated fats to unsaturated fats and
the elimination of industrial trans fats; less than
10 percent of total energy intake from free sugars
(preferably less than 5 percent); consumption of at
least 400 g of fruits and vegetables per day; and
not more than 5 g per day of salt (to be iodized).
Highly processed foods
Highly processed foods are foods that have been
industrially prepared, including those from
bakeries and catering outlets, and which require
no or minimal domestic preparation apart from
heating and cooking (such as bread, breakfast
cereals, cheese, commercial sauces, canned foods
including jams, commercial cakes, processed
meats, biscuits and sauces).41 Highly processed
foods can contain very high quantities of salt,
free sugars and saturated or trans fats and these
products, when consumed in high amounts, can
undermine diet quality.br
Hunger
Hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical
sensation caused by insufficient consumption of
dietary energy. In this report, the term hunger
is synonymous with chronic undernourishment
and is measured by the prevalence of
undernourishment (PoU).
Input subsidies
Government transfers to agricultural producers
arising from policy measures based on farm
use of inputs, or measures related to the
provision of inputs.
Macronutrients
Macronutrients are needed in larger quantities (in
gram range) and are the major source of energy
and bulk (volume) in our diets. They include
carbohydrates, protein and fats. They are a main
source of dietary energy, which is measured in
calories. Getting sufficient energy is essential
for everyone in order to maintain body growth,
development and good health. Carbohydrates,
protein and fats, in addition to providing energy,
each have very specific functions in the body and
must be supplied in sufficient amounts to carry
out those functions.
br For more details, please see Annex 5, Section C.
Malnutrition
An abnormal physiological condition caused
by inadequate, unbalanced or excessive intake
of macronutrients and/or micronutrients.
Malnutrition includes undernutrition (child
stunting and wasting, and vitamin and mineral
deficiencies) as well as overweight and obesity.
Micronutrients
Micronutrients include vitamins and minerals
and are required in very small (micro) but specific
amounts. Vitamins and minerals in foods are
necessary for the body to grow, develop and
function properly, and are essential for our health
and well-being. Our bodies require a number of
different vitamins and minerals, each of which
has a specific function in the body and must be
supplied in different, sufficient amounts.
Midstream food supply chains
Midstream food supply chains comprise the
post-farm gate activities related to the logistics,
processing and wholesale of food. This includes
cleaning, sorting, packaging, transportation,
storage and wholesaling of agricultural
and food products.
Moderate food insecurity
Refers to the level of severity of food insecurity,
based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale, at
which people face uncertainties about their ability
to obtain food and have been forced to reduce,
at times during the year, the quality and/or
quantity of food they consume due to lack of
money or other resources. It thus refers to a lack
of consistent access to food, which diminishes
dietary quality, disrupts normal eating patterns,
and can have negative consequences for nutrition,
health and well-being.
Nutrition transition
As incomes rise and populations become more
urban, diets high in complex carbohydrates and
fibre give way to more energy-dense diets high
in fats, sugars and/or salt. These global dietary
trends are accompanied by a demographic
transition with a shift towards increased life
expectancy and reduced fertility rates. At the
same time, disease patterns move away from
infectious and nutrient-deficiency diseases
towards higher rates of overweight and obesity
and diet-related non-communicable diseases
THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD 2023
| 249 |
including coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes
and some types of cancer.
Nutritional status
The physiological state of an individual that
results from the relationship between nutrient
intake and requirements and the body’s ability to
digest, absorb and use these nutrients.
Nutritious foods
These are referred to as safe foods that contribute
essential nutrients such as vitamins and minerals
(micronutrients), fibre and other components
to healthy diets that are beneficial for growth,
and health and development, guarding against
malnutrition. In nutritious foods, the presence
of nutrients of public health concern including
saturated fats, free sugars, and salt/sodium is
minimized, industrially produced trans fats are
eliminated, and salt is iodized.
Overweight and obesity
Defined as body weight that is above normal for
height as a result of an excessive accumulation of
fat. It is usually a manifestation of expending less
energy than is consumed. In adults, overweight is
defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2
 or
more, and obesity as a BMI of 30 kg/m2
 or more.
In children under five years of age, overweight
is defined as weight-for-height greater than 2
standard deviations above the WHO Child Growth
Standards median, and obesity as weight-for-height
greater than 3 standard deviations above the WHO
Child Growth Standards median.67
Prevalence of undernourishment (PoU)
An estimate of the proportion of the population
that lacks enough dietary energy for a healthy,
active life. It is FAO’s traditional indicator used to
monitor hunger at the global and regional level,
as well as SDG Indicator 2.1.1.
Resilience
Resilience is the ability of individuals,
households, communities, cities, institutions,
systems and societies to prevent, resist, absorb,
adapt, respond and recover positively, efficiently
and effectively when faced with a wide range of
risks, while maintaining an acceptable level of
functioning and without compromising long-term
prospects for sustainable development, peace and
security, human rights and well-being for all.68
Risk
The probability or likelihood of occurrence of
hazardous events or trends multiplied by the
impacts if these events or trends occur. Risk
to food insecurity is the probability of food
insecurity resulting from interactions between a
natural or human-induced hazard/shock/stress
and vulnerable conditions.
Rural–urban continuum
Represents a different way of examining
rural–urban spatial relationships across a
continuum, rather than the more conventional
rural/urban distinction. The rural–urban
continuum views rural and urban areas not as
separate spaces, but as two ends of a spectrum of
settlements and catchment areas of different sizes
and their linkages.
Severe food insecurity
The level of severity of food insecurity at which
people have likely run out of food, experienced
hunger and, at the most extreme, gone for
days without eating, putting their health and
well-being at grave risk, based on the Food
Insecurity Experience Scale.
Staple foods
Staple foods are those eaten regularly, and in
such quantities as to constitute the dominant
part of the diet and supply a major proportion
of total dietary energy. The main kinds of staple
foods are cereals (e.g. rice, maize, wheat, rye,
barley, oats, millet, sorghum), roots and tubers
(e.g. potatoes, cassava, yams) and legumes
(e.g. beans, lentils, soybean).55
Structural transformation
The theory of structural transformation describes
the transformation of economies, initiated with an
increase in agricultural productivity in rural areas
leading to an agricultural surplus. The additional
income from this surplus then generates demand
for other goods and services stimulating the
off-farm sectors of the economy. As a result, a
gradual shift of jobs from the primary agriculture
sector to the secondary and tertiary sectors takes
place, typically located in urban areas. This
encourages rural-to-urban migration, resulting
in an economic transformation from a mainly
agrarian to a more diversified national economy,
attracting rural people to urban areas.69
ANNEX 11
| 250 |
Stunting
Low height-for-age, reflecting a past episode or
episodes of sustained undernutrition. In children
under five years of age, stunting is defined as
height-for-age less than −2 standard deviations
below the WHO Child Growth Standards median.
Undernourishment
Undernourishment is defined as the condition in
which an individual’s habitual food consumption
is insufficient to provide the amount of dietary
energy required to maintain a normal, active,
healthy life. For the purposes of this report,
hunger is defined as being synonymous with
chronic undernourishment. The prevalence of
undernourishment is used to measure hunger.
Undernutrition
The outcome of poor nutritional intake in terms of
quantity and/or quality, and/or poor absorption
and/or poor biological use of nutrients consumed
as a result of repeated instances of disease. It
includes being underweight for one’s age, too
short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin
for one’s height (suffering from wasting) or
deficient in vitamins and minerals (suffering from
micronutrient deficiency).
Urban and peri-urban agriculture (UPA)
Urban and peri-urban agriculture can be
defined as practices that yield foods and other
outputs from agricultural production and
related processes (transformation, distribution,
marketing, recycling, etc.), taking place on land
and other spaces within cities and surrounding
regions. These involve urban and peri-urban
actors, communities, methods, places, policies,
institutions, systems, ecologies and economies,
largely using and regenerating local resources
to meet the changing needs of local populations
while serving multiple goals and functions.70
Urbanization
Urbanization is a multifaceted social, cultural,
economic and physical process that is the result
of growing urban populations, the physical
expansion of cities (i.e. the reclassification
of rural to urban) and migration from rural
to urban areas. This process is fickle and
context-dependent, driven by intertwined factors
including diverse economic developments such as
the growth of agriculture, policy choices, natural
resource availability and other events such as
conflict or environmental degradation.69
Vulnerability
Refers to the conditions determined by physical,
social, economic and environmental factors or
processes that increase the susceptibility of an
individual, community, assets or systems to
the impacts of hazards.66 Vulnerability to food
insecurity is the range of conditions that increases
the susceptibility of a household to the impact on
food security in case of a shock or hazard.
Wasting
Low weight-for-height, generally the result of
weight loss associated with a recent period of
inadequate dietary energy intake and/or disease.
In children under five years of age, wasting is
defined as weight-for-height less than −2 standard
deviations below the WHO Child Growth
Standards median.
Weather
Weather describes conditions of the atmosphere
over a short period of time (minutes to days),
whereas climate is how the atmosphere
behaves over relatively longer periods of time
(the long-term average of weather over time).
The difference between weather and climate
is a measure of time (see above definitions for
climate, climate change, climate variability and
climate extremes).71 n

NOTES ON GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN STATISTICAL TABLES
IN CHAPTER 2 AND ANNEXES 1 AND 2
Countries revise their official statistics regularly for past
periods as well as for the latest reporting period. The same
holds for statistics presented in this report. Whenever this
happens, estimates are revised accordingly. Therefore,
users are advised to refer to changes in estimates over time
only within the same edition of The State of Food Security and
Nutrition in the World and refrain from comparing data
published in editions for different years.

FOOD SECURITY
AND NUTRITION
IN THE WORLD
THE STATE OF
URBANIZATION, AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS
TRANSFORMATION AND HEALTHY DIETS
ACROSS THE RURAL–URBAN CONTINUUM
This report provides an update on global progress towards the targets of ending hunger (SDG Target 2.1)
and all forms of malnutrition (SDG Target 2.2). It shows that hunger at the global level remained
relatively stable between 2021 and 2022, but is still far above pre-COVID-19-pandemic levels and is
also rising in many places where people are still struggling to recover income losses in the wake of the
pandemic or have been affected by increasing prices of food, agricultural inputs and energy, conflicts
and/or extreme climate events. The report also provides updated estimates on the billions of people who
are unable to access nutritious, safe and sufficient food all year round. Overall, the report shows that we
are far off track to meet all nutrition targets. While progress on important indicators of child nutrition is
revealed, rising overweight among children under five years of age in many countries portends growing
burdens of non-communicable diseases.
Since its 2017 edition, this report has repeatedly highlighted that the intensification and interaction of
conflict, climate extremes and economic slowdowns and downturns, combined with highly unaffordable
nutritious foods and growing inequality, are pushing us off track to meet the SDG 2 targets. However,
other important megatrends must also be factored into the analysis to fully understand the challenges to
and opportunities for meeting the SDG 2 targets. One such megatrend, and the focus of this year’s
report, is urbanization.
Urbanization is increasing in many countries and this report shows it is changing agrifood systems in
ways we can no longer understand using the simple rural–urban divide. The changing pattern of
population agglomerations across a rural–urban continuum and its interface as a place of exchange and
socioeconomic interactions, is reshaping and being reshaped by agrifood systems, with implications for
the availability and affordability of healthy diets, and in turn, for food security and nutrition.
New evidence shows that food purchases in some countries are no longer high only among urban
households but also among rural households. Consumption of highly processed foods is also increasing
in peri-urban and rural areas of some countries. These changes are affecting people’s food security and
nutrition in ways that differ depending on where they live across the rural–urban continuum.
This timely and relevant theme is aligned with the United Nations General Assembly-endorsed New
Urban Agenda, and the report provides recommendations on the policies, investments and actions
needed to address the challenges of agrifood systems transformation under urbanization and to enable
opportunities for ensuring access to affordable healthy diets for everyone.
